3. Gating network for expert selection
4. Expert-specific uncertainties
5. Train and evaluate vs Phase 2.1

**Estimated Timeline:** 1 week (3 days implementation, 2 days training, 2 days evaluation)

---

### Phase 2.3: Expand Shock Event Database (CONCURRENT)

**Status:** Scraping infrastructure designed

**Tasks:**
1. **Historical Backfill (1999-2019)**
   - Injuries: pro-football-reference.com scraper
   - Coaching: Wikipedia/ESPN archives
   - Trades: Spotrac API integration
   - Target: +500 events

2. **New Event Types**
   - Suspension returns (+50 events)
   - Bye week effects (+100 events)
   - Prime time games (+30 events)
   - Rivalry games (+20 events)
   - Target: +200 events

3. **Data Quality**
   - Severity classification (games missed: 1, 2-4, 5+)
   - Context enrichment (team record, opponent)
   - Duplicate detection

**Expected Database:** 850+ events (vs 147 baseline, 478% increase)

**Implementation Files:**
- `py/causal/data_scrapers/injury_scraper.py`
- `py/causal/data_scrapers/coaching_scraper.py`
- `py/causal/data_scrapers/trade_scraper.py`

### Phase 3.1: Real-Time Shock Detection Pipeline

**Status:** Architecture designed (see PHASE_PLAN.md lines 340-520)

**Components:**

1. **Data Sources (APIs)**
   - NFL Official Injury API
   - Twitter/X monitoring (@AdamSchefter, @RapSheet)
   - NOAA Weather API (24h forecasts)
   - ESPN/NFL.com news RSS feeds

2. **Event Classification**
   - NLP keyword detection ("out", "doubtful", "fired")
   - Severity assessment
   - Duplicate detection
   - Context enrichment

3. **Leverage Scoring**
   ```python
   leverage = |treatment_effect| × (1 - market_efficiency) × urgency
   ```
   - High: >5.0 (immediate alert)
   - Medium: 3.0-5.0 (batched alert)
   - Low: <3.0 (log only)

4. **Alerting Integration**
   - Slack webhooks
   - Email notifications
   - Dashboard updates

**Implementation Files:**
- `py/causal/shock_detector.py` (main service)
- `py/causal/sources/nfl_api.py`
- `py/causal/sources/twitter_monitor.py`
- `py/causal/sources/weather_forecast.py`

**Estimated Timeline:** 3 weeks (1 week per: scrapers, classification, alerting)

---

### Phase 3.2: Automated Adjustment Workflow

**Status:** Workflow designed (see PHASE_PLAN.md lines 522-660)

**Pipeline:**
1. Shock detected (leverage > 3.0)
2. Retrieve baseline prediction
3. Lookup treatment effect from database
4. Compute Bayesian adjustment (precision-weighted)
5. Compare to market line
6. Generate recommendation
7. Auto-execute or manual review

**Safety Checks:**
- Sanity bounds (adjustment ≤ ±14 points)
- Model drift detection
- Position limits (weekly exposure)
- Historical analog validation
- Uncertainty inflation (1.5-2.0×)

**Implementation Files:**
- `py/causal/adjustment_workflow.py`
- `py/causal/risk_gates.py`
- `py/causal/treatment_database.py`

**Estimated Timeline:** 2 weeks (1 week implementation, 1 week backtesting)

- **Weeks 9+:** Full production (50%, leverage >3.0)

**Risk Gates:**
1. Sanity bounds check
2. Model drift check (Brier > 1.2× baseline)
3. Position limit check (weekly exposure)
4. Market efficiency check
5. Historical analog validation
6. Uncertainty budget check

**Kill Switch Conditions:**

## 🚀 EXECUTION MODE: FULLY AUTONOMOUS

Per user request, all subsequent work will proceed autonomously following the roadmap in PHASE_PLAN.md. Key decision points have pre-defined criteria:

**Decision Tree:**
1. **If Phase 2.1 achieves ≥75% coverage** → Proceed to Phase 2.3 (database expansion)
2. **If Phase 2.1 achieves 50-75% coverage** → Try Phase 2.2 (mixture-of-experts)
3. **If Phase 2.1 achieves <50% coverage** → Implement hybrid calibration (Phase 2.3 fallback)
4. **Once calibration fixed** → Phase 3 (detection pipeline)
5. **Once detection operational** → Phase 4 (production deployment)

All intermediate results will be logged to `experiments/` and `logs/` directories for review.
