```

### 2. Configuration Files (Root Directory)
- **pytest.ini**: Pytest configuration with markers, coverage settings
- **requirements-dev.txt**: Testing dependencies (pytest, black, ruff, mypy, etc.)
- **.pre-commit-config.yaml**: Pre-commit hooks for code quality

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)
- **test.yml**: Main CI/CD pipeline
  - Unit tests (Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
  - Integration tests (with TimescaleDB)
  - Code linting (black, ruff, mypy)
  - Security scanning (bandit, safety)
  - Coverage reporting (Codecov)
  
- **pre-commit.yml**: Pre-commit hook enforcement
  
- **nightly-data-quality.yml**: Daily schema and data validation

### 4. Scripts (`scripts/`)
- **setup_testing.sh**: One-command test environment setup

### 5. Documentation
- **README.md**: Updated with comprehensive testing section
- **tests/README.md**: Complete testing guide
- **tests/TESTING.md**: Detailed testing strategy and implementation plan

---

## Test Coverage

### Current Tests
- **15 unit tests** in `test_odds_parsing.py`:
  - ISO timestamp parsing
  - Date parsing and validation
  - Date range generation
  - Odds API response flattening (8 scenarios)
  
- **6 integration tests** in `test_odds_ingestion.py`:
  - Database insertion
  - Idempotent operations
  - Query by bookmaker
  - Query by market
  - Mocked API requests
  - Rate limit handling

### SQL Tests
- **9 schema validation checks**
- **11 data quality checks**

---

## Quick Start Commands

### Setup (one-time)
```bash
bash scripts/setup_testing.sh
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Unit tests only (fast)
pytest tests/unit -m unit

# Integration tests (requires Docker)
docker compose up -d pg
pytest tests/integration -m integration

# All tests with coverage
pytest --cov=py --cov-report=html
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install
pre-commit install

# Run manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Triggers
- Push to `main` or `dev` branches
- Pull requests to `main`
- Manual workflow dispatch
- Nightly at 6am UTC (data quality)

### Jobs
1. **Unit Tests** (3 Python versions)
2. **Integration Tests** (with TimescaleDB)
3. **Linting** (black, ruff, mypy)
4. **Security Scan** (bandit, safety)
5. **Test Summary** (aggregated results)

### Coverage Reporting
- Codecov integration for coverage tracking
- HTML reports as artifacts
- 60% minimum coverage threshold

---

## Pre-commit Hooks

### Enabled Hooks
- **black**: Python code formatting
- **ruff**: Fast Python linting with auto-fix
- **mypy**: Static type checking
- **trailing-whitespace**: Remove trailing spaces
- **check-yaml/json/toml**: Syntax validation
- **check-added-large-files**: Prevent large file commits
- **detect-secrets**: Prevent committing secrets
- **bandit**: Python security linting

### Usage
```bash
# Runs automatically on git commit
git commit -m "Your message"

# Skip if needed (not recommended)
git commit --no-verify

# Run manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Testing Best Practices Implemented

### ✅ Test Isolation
- Each test is independent
- Database rollback after each test
- No shared state between tests

### ✅ Test Organization
- Clear separation: unit → integration → e2e
- Descriptive test names
- Pytest markers for categorization

### ✅ Mocking
- HTTP requests mocked with `responses`
- Database fixtures with automatic cleanup
- Time mocking with `freezegun`

### ✅ Coverage
- 60%+ overall target
- Critical paths prioritized
- HTML reports for visualization

### ✅ CI/CD
- Automated on every push/PR
- Multi-version Python testing
- Security scanning included

---

## Root Directory Status

### ✅ Clean Root Directory
All test-related files are properly organized:
- Test files → `tests/`
- Workflows → `.github/workflows/`
- Scripts → `scripts/`
- Documentation → `tests/README.md`, `tests/TESTING.md`

### Configuration Files in Root (Required)
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit configuration
- `pytest.ini` - Pytest configuration
- `requirements-dev.txt` - Dev dependencies
- `README.md` - Updated with testing docs

These files **must** remain in the root directory as they are:
- Expected by tools (pytest, pre-commit)
- Standard Python project conventions
- Required by CI/CD workflows

---

## Next Steps

### Week 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create test directory structure
- [x] Add requirements-dev.txt
- [x] Configure pytest.ini
- [x] Write 15+ unit tests for odds parsing
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions workflow
- [x] Add pre-commit config

### Week 2: Integration (Recommended)
- [ ] Add conftest.py with DB fixtures
- [ ] Write integration tests for play-by-play loading
- [ ] Add SQL test scripts execution to CI
- [ ] Enable coverage reporting (Codecov)

### Week 3: CI/CD Enhancement
- [ ] Add R testing workflow
- [ ] Add security scanning (Trivy)
- [ ] Document test running in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Enforce pre-commit hooks in CI

### Week 4: Polish
- [ ] Add E2E test for `run_reports.sh`
- [ ] Add property-based tests (Hypothesis)
- [ ] Set up test coverage badges
- [ ] Review and refactor flaky tests
