-- Migration: Remove duplicate weather columns from games, update mart.game_summary
-- Date: 2025-10-04
-- Purpose: Clean up weather data duplication (games.temp/wind vs weather.temp_c/wind_kph)

-- Step 1: Backup existing data (already done)
-- Table games_weather_backup created with 5,016 rows

-- Step 2: Drop and recreate mart.game_summary WITHOUT temp/wind
-- Instead, LEFT JOIN to weather table for temp_c/wind_kph
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS mart.game_summary CASCADE;
