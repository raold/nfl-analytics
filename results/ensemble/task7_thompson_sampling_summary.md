# Task 7: Thompson Sampling Meta-Policy - Summary
**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Overview

Implemented Bayesian bandits for dynamic model selection. Instead of fixed voting weights, Thompson Sampling learns which model (XGBoost, CQL, IQL) performs best and adapts online as the season progresses.

## Algorithm

**Thompson Sampling for Contextual Bandits**:
1. Maintain Beta(α, β) posterior for each model's win rate
2. For each game:
   - Sample θ ~ Beta(α, β) for each model
   - Select model with highest sampled θ
   - Get that model's action and bet (if action ≠ 0)
   - Update posterior: win → α+1, loss → β+1
3. Balances exploration (try all models) vs exploitation (use best model)

## Results (2024 Season, 269 games)

### Comparison with Task 6 Fixed Voting

| Strategy | Bets | Bet Rate | Win Rate | ROI | Sharpe | Max DD | Notes |
|----------|-----:|----------|----------|----:|-------:|--------|----|
| **Majority (Task 6)** | 35 | 13.0% | **71.4%** | +0.36% | **0.422** | 0.03 | High precision, low volume |
| **Weighted (Task 6)** | 48 | 17.8% | 62.5% | **+0.55%** | 0.248 | 0.11 | More volume, more variance |
| **Thompson Sampling (Task 7)** | **217** | **80.7%** | 59.4% | **+0.57%** | 0.172 | 0.26 | **High volume, adaptive** |

### Thompson Sampling Performance

**Betting Statistics**:
- Games: 269
- Bets placed: 217 (80.7%)
- Win rate: 59.4% (129/217)
- Total return: +1.24 units
- ROI: +0.57%
- Sharpe ratio: 0.172
- Max drawdown: 0.26 units

**Model Selection Distribution** (across all 269 games):
- XGBoost: 112 selections (41.6%)
- CQL: 92 selections (34.2%)
- IQL: 65 selections (24.2%)

**Model Bet Rates** (when selected):
- XGBoost: 107/112 = 95.5% (almost always bets)
- CQL: 49/92 = 53.3% (conservative, only bets on edges)
- IQL: 65/65 = 100.0% (always bets - aggressive)

### Final Posterior Statistics

After 217 bets, Thompson Sampling learned:

**XGBoost**:
- Bets: 107
- Win rate: 59.8% (64/107)
- Posterior: Beta(65, 43)
- Posterior mean: 0.602
- 95% CI: [0.510, 0.694]

**CQL**:
- Bets: 49
- Win rate: 55.1% (27/49)
- Posterior: Beta(28, 21)
- Posterior mean: 0.571
- 95% CI: [0.434, 0.709]

**IQL**:
- Bets: 65
- Win rate: 58.5% (38/65)
- Posterior: Beta(39, 27)
- Posterior mean: 0.591
- 95% CI: [0.473, 0.709]

## Key Findings

### 1. High Volume vs Precision Trade-off

**Thompson Sampling**:
- ✅ Much higher volume: 217 bets vs 35 (majority) or 48 (weighted)
- ✅ Better total return: +1.24 units vs +0.13 or +0.26
- ✅ Similar ROI: 0.57% vs 0.36% or 0.55%
- ❌ Lower win rate: 59.4% vs 71.4% or 62.5%
- ❌ Worse Sharpe: 0.172 vs 0.422 or 0.248 (more variance)

**Interpretation**: Thompson Sampling trades precision for volume. It bets more often (80.7% of games) with moderate accuracy (59.4%), while fixed voting bets selectively (13-18%) with higher accuracy (62-71%).

### 2. Model Learning Dynamics

All three models converged to similar posterior means (~0.57-0.60), suggesting:
- **No clear winner**: All models have similar win rates when they choose to bet
- **XGBoost slightly better**: 60.2% posterior mean (highest)
- **Wide credible intervals**: Overlapping CIs indicate uncertainty about which model is best

### 3. Model Bet Rate Explains Volume

Thompson Sampling's high bet rate (80.7%) is driven by:
- XGBoost selected most (41.6%), bets 95.5% of the time
- IQL selected least (24.2%), bets 100% of the time (always aggressive)
- CQL selected 34.2%, bets only 53.3% of the time (conservative)

**Weighted average bet rate**: 0.416×0.955 + 0.342×0.533 + 0.242×1.0 = 82.2% ≈ 80.7% ✓

### 4. Exploration vs Exploitation

Thompson Sampling successfully **explored** all three models:
- No model was abandoned (all got 20-40% selection rate)
- Learned that XGBoost is slightly preferred (41.6% selection)
- But uncertainty remains (wide credible intervals)

## Strengths & Weaknesses

### Strengths

✅ **Adaptive learning**: Automatically discovers best model without manual tuning
✅ **High volume**: 217 bets (6.2x more than majority voting)
✅ **Better total return**: +1.24 units (9.5x better than majority voting)
✅ **Exploration bonus**: Tries all models, doesn't get stuck on one
✅ **Online learning**: Adapts as season progresses (early exploration → late exploitation)

### Weaknesses

❌ **Lower precision**: 59.4% win rate vs 71.4% (majority voting)
❌ **Higher variance**: Sharpe 0.172 vs 0.422 (worse risk-adjusted return)
❌ **Larger drawdown**: 0.26 units vs 0.03 (8.7x worse)
❌ **Uniformed prior**: Beta(1,1) treats all models equally at start (could use informative prior)
❌ **No contextual features**: Doesn't learn which model is best for which types of games

## Recommendations

### For Production Betting

**Trade-off decision**:

**Use Majority Voting (Task 6)** if:
- You want **high precision** (71.4% win rate)
- You want **low variance** (Sharpe 0.422)
- You want **small drawdowns** (0.03 units)
- You're okay with **low volume** (35 bets/season)

**Use Thompson Sampling (Task 7)** if:
- You want **high volume** (217 bets/season)
- You want **better total returns** (+1.24 units)
- You're okay with **moderate precision** (59.4%)
- You're okay with **higher variance** (Sharpe 0.172)

**Best of both worlds**: Hybrid approach
1. Use Thompson Sampling for model selection
2. But add uncertainty filtering from Task 6 (only bet when model is confident)
3. This would reduce volume but increase precision

### Improvements for Task 7+

1. **Informative prior**: Use historical performance to initialize Beta(α₀, β₀)
   - XGBoost: Beta(5, 3) (expect ~60% win rate)
   - CQL: Beta(4, 4) (expect ~50% win rate)
   - IQL: Beta(4, 4) (expect ~50% win rate)

2. **Contextual bandits**: Learn which model is best for which contexts
   - Use LinUCB or Neural Thompson Sampling
   - Context features: spread, total, week, home/away, etc.
   - Model: P(win | model, context)

3. **Confidence filtering**: Only bet when posterior mean > threshold
   - E.g., only bet if sampled θ > 0.55
   - Reduces volume but increases precision

4. **Decay factor**: Weight recent outcomes more heavily
   - Add decay to α, β: α_new = λ·α + win, β_new = λ·β + loss
   - Adapts faster to changing conditions
