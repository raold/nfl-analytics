### Task 10: Copula Models for Parlay Pricing ✅
**Implementation**: Complete (`py/pricing/copula_parlays.py`, 370 lines)
**Dissertation**: ADDED to Technical Appendix

**Content Added**:
- Motivation: Standard independence assumption fails for correlated games
- Sources of correlation:
  - Same week: +5%
  - Shared teams: +15%
  - Same division: +10%
  - Conference dynamics: +5%
- Gaussian copula framework:
  - Probability integral transform for correlation estimation
  - Monte Carlo simulation (10,000 trials)
  - Expected value calculation
- Example: 2-game parlay showing how correlation flips -0.78% EV to +0.29% EV
- Impact scenarios: Same-game parlays (5-10% improvement), Division games (2-5%), Playoff games (1-3%)
- Expected edge: +0.5-1% realistic, +0-0.5% pessimistic
- Teaser pricing extension
- **Production recommendation**: SKIP parlay betting (10-30% vig too hard to overcome)
- **Research recommendation**: INCLUDE (advanced statistical modeling, novel application)

## Key Findings from Tasks 8-10

### Task 8: Bootstrap Stress Testing
**Most Resilient Strategy**: Majority voting
- Worst case: +0.07% return
- CVaR(95%): -0.05% (1 unit loss)
- Survives all stress scenarios

**Most Vulnerable Strategy**: Thompson Sampling
- Worst case: -0.22% return
- CVaR(95%): -1.29% (27 units loss)
- 26× worse tail risk than Majority voting

**Insight**: Volume increases both returns AND risk. Conservative production deployment should prioritize Majority voting for resilience.

### Task 9: GNN Team Ratings
**Theoretical Promise**: Explicit transitive strength modeling via message passing
**Practical Reality**: Marginal improvement (0.5-1%) doesn't justify complexity
**Production**: Skip (use existing EPA features)
**Research**: Include (demonstrates modern ML, valuable negative result)

**Insight**: Sometimes the simple baseline (XGBoost with engineered features) beats fancy deep learning. The sparse NFL game graph (17 games/season) limits message passing effectiveness.

### Task 10: Copula Models for Parlay Pricing
**Key Discovery**: Positive correlation HELPS parlays when all legs are favored
**Example**: 2-game parlay flips from -0.78% EV (independence) to +0.29% EV (copula with ρ=0.15)
**Production**: Skip parlay betting (vig too high)
**Research**: Include (advanced statistics, novel application)

**Insight**: Correlation modeling is theoretically correct but practically insufficient to overcome 10-30% parlay vig. Single-game bets remain superior strategy.
