# Autonomous Execution Summary

**Started**: October 16, 2025 @ 2:07 PM EDT
**Status**: ✅ Task 1 Complete, ⏳ Task 2 In Progress

---

## Task 1: GitHub Cleanup ✅ COMPLETE

### Removed from GitHub (kept locally):
- uv.lock, renv.lock (package lock files)
- .Rprofile (R user config)
- .DS_Store files (19 files across directories)

### Updated .gitignore:
- Added: `uv.lock`, `renv.lock`, `.Rprofile`
- Added: `models/**/*.pkl` (large model binaries)

### Commits:
1. `2d18b18`: Remove lock files, .Rprofile, and .DS_Store from tracking
2. `49c2134`: Phase 2: Launch prior sensitivity analysis (4 parallel training jobs)

✅ GitHub now clean - all sensitive/generated files removed from public repo

---

## Task 2: Phase 2 Prior Sensitivity Analysis ⏳ IN PROGRESS

### Objective:
Identify optimal noise_sigma to improve BNN calibration from 26% → 85-95% coverage

### Hypothesis:
Current sigma=0.3 is too tight, restricting posterior uncertainty. Relaxing sigma should widen prediction intervals and improve calibration.

### Training Jobs Launched (2:08 PM):
| Sigma | Status | Progress | ETA |
|-------|--------|----------|-----|
| 0.5 | ✅ RUNNING | MCMC sampling in progress | ~2:38 PM |
| 0.7 | ✅ RUNNING | MCMC sampling in progress | ~2:38 PM |
| 1.0 | ✅ RUNNING | MCMC sampling in progress | ~2:38 PM |
| 1.5 | ✅ RUNNING | MCMC sampling in progress | ~2:38 PM |

### Technical Details:
- **Architecture**: 16 hidden units, ReLU activation, hierarchical player effects
- **Features**: Baseline 4 only (carries, avg_rushing_l3, season_avg, week)
- **Training**: 2000 samples × 4 chains = 8000 MCMC samples per model
- **Dataset**: 2663 training samples, 374 test samples (2020-2024)
- **Parallel Execution**: All 4 jobs running simultaneously on 4 CPU cores each

### Files Created:
- `py/models/train_bnn_prior_sensitivity.py` - Training script (358 LOC)
- `py/models/monitor_prior_sensitivity.py` - Results monitoring (148 LOC)
- `PHASE2_PRIOR_SENSITIVITY_LAUNCHED.md` - Full documentation

### Expected Outputs (auto-generated upon completion):
- `models/bayesian/bnn_rushing_sigma{0.5,0.7,1.0,1.5}.pkl`
- `experiments/calibration/prior_sensitivity_sigma{0.5,0.7,1.0,1.5}.json`

## Autonomous Actions Planned

Once training completes (~2:38 PM), I will automatically:

1. **Extract Results**: Load all 4 JSON result files
2. **Identify Optimal Sigma**: Find sigma with coverage closest to 90% (target: 85-95%)
3. **Validate Quality**: Ensure MAE remains stable (~18-20 yards)
4. **Generate Analysis**: Create comparison table and recommendations
5. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update `docs/BNN_CALIBRATION_EXPLORATION.md` with Phase 2 findings
   - Update `experiments/calibration/summary.json`
6. **Recommend Next Steps**:
   - If success: Phase 3 - Validate on extended features
   - If partial: Phase 3 - Combine optimal sigma with feature engineering
   - If failure: Investigate alternative model architectures

## Progress Monitoring

**Automatic checks**: Every 5 minutes via background monitor

**Manual check**:
```bash
uv run python py/models/monitor_prior_sensitivity.py --once
```

**View logs**:
```bash
tail -f logs/bnn_sigma0.5.log  # or 0.7, 1.0, 1.5
```

**Process status**:
```bash
ps aux | grep "train_bnn_prior_sensitivity" | grep -v grep | wc -l
# Should show 24 (4 jobs × 4 chains + overhead)
```

## Key Metrics to Watch

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Current Best |
|--------|----------|--------|--------------|
| 90% CI Coverage | 26.2% | 85-95% | TBD (~30 min) |
| 68% CI Coverage | 19.5% | 60-75% | TBD |
| MAE | 18.7 yards | <20 yards | TBD |
| Training Time | N/A | ~30 min | ~30 min |

## Timeline

- **14:07**: Autonomous mode engaged
- **14:07**: GitHub cleanup initiated
- **14:08**: GitHub cleanup complete (2 commits pushed)
- **14:08**: Phase 2 training launched (4 parallel jobs)
- **14:11**: Monitoring initialized, background checks every 5 min
- **14:38** (estimated): Training complete, results analysis begins

## Status: FULLY AUTONOMOUS

No user input required. All actions executing according to plan.

Will report final Phase 2 results when training completes in ~27 minutes.

**Next check**: 2:16 PM EDT (5 minutes from launch)
**Estimated completion**: 2:38 PM EDT (30 minutes from launch)
**Final report**: 2:45 PM EDT (with analysis and recommendations)
