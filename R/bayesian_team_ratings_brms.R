# Bayesian Hierarchical Team Ratings with BRMS
#
# Full Bayesian multilevel model for NFL team strength using brms/Stan.
# Implements three models:
#   1. Hierarchical team effects (attack/defense) with time-varying parameters
#   2. Correlated random effects for offense/defense by team
#   3. Full model with home advantage, era effects, and seasonal structure
#
# This leverages R's unparalleled Bayesian modeling stack (brms, rstan, loo)
# to provide principled uncertainty quantification for team strength.
