# State-Space Models for Dynamic Player Skill Tracking
#
# Implements time-varying player ratings using:
# 1. Local-level model (random walk with drift)
# 2. Local-linear trend model (trending skill changes)
# 3. Integration with brms for hierarchical structure
#
# Key Innovation: Player skill evolves over time, captures:
# - Hot/cold streaks
# - Injury recovery trajectories
# - Aging curves
# - Momentum effects
