## Current Activity

### Phase 2.1: Simpler BNN v2 (IN PROGRESS)
- **PID**: 76582 (training process)
- **Started**: 5:16 AM
- **CPU**: 99.9% (active MCMC sampling)
- **Expected Duration**: ~65-70 minutes
- **Architecture**:
  - 2-layer network (input → 24 hidden → output)
  - Student-t likelihood (df=4) for heavier tails
  - HalfNormal(20) noise prior (vs HalfNormal(5) in Phase 1)
  - Target: 90% CI coverage ≥ 75% (vs Phase 1: 26%)

### Autonomous Runner (ACTIVE)
- **PID**: 84229, 84240
- **Status**: Monitoring Phase 2.1 completion
- **Will automatically**:
  1. Detect Phase 2.1 completion
  2. Run Phase 2.2 (Mixture-of-Experts BNN)
  3. Compare both architectures
  4. Generate recommendations

## Implementation Summary

### Phase 2.1: Simpler BNN v2
**File**: `py/models/bnn_simpler_v2.py`

**Key Changes from Phase 1**:
1. **Wider noise prior**: HalfNormal(20) vs HalfNormal(5)
   - Phase 1's tight prior → under-calibration (26%)
   - Wider prior allows more uncertainty → better calibration

2. **Student-t likelihood** (df=4):
   - Heavier tails than Normal distribution
   - Better handles outliers and extreme performances

3. **Slightly wider hidden layer**: 24 vs 16 units
   - More capacity without going too deep
   - Avoids MCMC sampling failures of deeper networks

**Expected Outcome**: 75-85% calibration (90% CI coverage)

### Phase 2.2: Mixture-of-Experts BNN
**File**: `py/models/bnn_mixture_experts_v2.py`

**Architecture**:
- **3 Expert Networks**:
  - Expert 0: Low variance (bench players) - σ ~ HalfNormal(10)
  - Expert 1: Medium variance (starters) - σ ~ HalfNormal(15)
  - Expert 2: High variance (stars) - σ ~ HalfNormal(20)

- **Gating Network**:
  - Learns which expert to use for each sample
  - Softmax over expert weights (sum to 1)

- **Heterogeneous Uncertainty**:
  - Different experts for different player types
  - Better models varying prediction difficulty

**Expected Outcome**: 80-90% calibration with improved MAE

## How to Monitor

### Quick Status Check
```bash
./check_phase2_status.sh
```

### Live Monitoring
```bash
# Phase 2.1 training
tail -f logs/bnn_simpler_v2_*.log

# Autonomous runner
tail -f logs/autonomous_phase2_*.log
```

### Manual Check
```bash
# Check if training is still running
ps aux | grep bnn_simpler

# Check for completed models
ls -lh models/bayesian/bnn_simpler_v2.pkl
ls -lh experiments/calibration/simpler_bnn_v2_results.json
```

## Decision Tree

```
Phase 2.1 Complete
    ├─ Coverage ≥ 75%?
    │   ├─ YES → ✓ Use Phase 2.1, run Phase 2.2 for comparison
    │   └─ NO → Proceed to Phase 2.2
    │
    └─ Phase 2.2 Complete
        ├─ Coverage ≥ 75%?
        │   ├─ YES → ✓ Use Phase 2.2
        │   └─ NO → Implement hybrid calibration (Phase 2.3)
        │
        └─ Compare Results
            ├─ Best model selected
            ├─ Comparison saved: experiments/calibration/phase2_comparison.json
            └─ Update dissertation tables
```

## Success Criteria

**Phase 2.1**:
- ✅ Training completes without divergences
- ✅ 90% CI coverage ≥ 75% (vs 26% Phase 1)
- ✅ MAE maintained or improved (≤19 yards vs 18.7 baseline)

**Phase 2.2**:
- ✅ Expert utilization is reasonable (not all weight on one expert)
- ✅ Calibration improved over Phase 2.1
- ✅ Complexity justified by performance gain

**Overall**:
- ✅ At least one model achieves ≥75% coverage
- ✅ Results documented and saved
- ✅ Comparison table generated
- ✅ Ready for dissertation integration

## What Happens Next (Fully Autonomous)

1. **Phase 2.1 completes** (~65 min from start)
   - Model saved: `models/bayesian/bnn_simpler_v2.pkl`
   - Results saved: `experiments/calibration/simpler_bnn_v2_results.json`

2. **Autonomous runner detects completion**
   - Validates files exist
   - Loads and displays Phase 2.1 results

3. **Phase 2.2 automatically starts**
   - ~60-90 minute runtime
   - 3 expert networks train in parallel via gating

4. **Comparison automatically generated**
   - Side-by-side metrics table
   - Recommendation based on coverage + MAE
   - Saved to `experiments/calibration/phase2_comparison.json`

5. **Next steps determined**:
   - If success (≥75%): Update dissertation, proceed to Phase 2.3 (database expansion)
   - If partial (50-75%): Consider hybrid calibration
   - If failure (<50%): Analyze why and implement fallback

## Recovery Plan (If Crash Occurs)

If the session crashes during training:

1. **Check if Phase 2.1 completed**:
   ```bash
   ls -lh models/bayesian/bnn_simpler_v2.pkl
   ```

2. **If completed**: Phase 2.2 will run automatically when you restart autonomous_phase2_runner.py

3. **If not completed**:
   ```bash
   # Check progress
   tail logs/bnn_simpler_v2_*.log

   # If crashed mid-training, restart
   uv run python py/models/bnn_simpler_v2.py
   ```

4. **Resume autonomous execution**:
   ```bash
   uv run python py/models/autonomous_phase2_runner.py
   ```

**Status**: System is running autonomously. Check back in ~2-3 hours for final results.
