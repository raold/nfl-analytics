# Causal Inference Framework for NFL Analytics

## Overview

This framework implements state-of-the-art causal inference methods to move beyond correlation-based predictions to true causal understanding. It enables answering counterfactual questions like "What would team performance be if the star RB hadn't gotten injured?" or "What is the true causal effect of a coaching change?"

**Status**: Phase 6 Complete (All modules implemented)
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Location**: `py/causal/`

## Motivation

Traditional predictive models answer "What will happen?" but struggle with:
- **Shock events**: Injuries, coaching changes, trades
- **Confounding**: Player ability affects both usage and outcomes
- **Selection bias**: Star players get more carries (endogenous treatment)
- **Counterfactuals**: "What if?" questions for betting edges

Causal inference addresses these by identifying and adjusting for confounding, enabling valid causal estimates even from observational data.

### 1. Panel Data Constructor (`panel_constructor.py`)

**Purpose**: Build longitudinal panel datasets suitable for causal analysis.

**Key Features**:
- Player-game panel with 30+ features
- Team-game panel for team-level analysis
- Treatment indicators (injuries, trades, coaching changes)
- Rolling averages and temporal features
- Propensity score matching utilities

**Usage**:
```python
from causal.panel_constructor import PanelConstructor

constructor = PanelConstructor(db_connection)
panel = constructor.build_player_game_panel(
    start_season=2020,
    end_season=2024,
    position_groups=['RB', 'WR']
)
```

**Output**: DataFrame with panel structure (player × week observations) including:
- `player_id`, `season`, `week`
- Performance metrics: `stat_yards`, `stat_carries`, `stat_targets`
- Context: `opponent_defense_rank`, `is_home`, `temperature`
- Treatments: `injury_flag`, `games_missed`, `post_injury`
- Derived: `recent_avg_yards`, `consistency`, `is_star`

---

### 2. Treatment Definitions (`treatment_definitions.py`)

**Purpose**: Identify and define treatment conditions for causal analysis.

**Treatments Implemented**:
1. **Injuries**: Player misses games → returns
2. **Coaching changes**: Mid-season firings (includes known examples: Raiders 2021, Panthers 2022-23, etc.)
3. **Trades**: Player changes teams mid-season
4. **Weather**: Extreme cold, wind, or precipitation
5. **Synthetic**: Placebo treatments for validation

**Key Methods**:
- `define_injury_treatment()`: Identifies injury events from game gaps
- `define_coaching_change_treatment()`: Marks known coaching changes
- `create_treatment_windows()`: Pre/post periods for analysis
- `validate_treatment_assignment()`: Checks covariate balance

**Usage**:
```python
from causal.treatment_definitions import TreatmentDefiner

definer = TreatmentDefiner()

# Add injury treatment indicators
panel = definer.define_injury_treatment(
    panel,
    min_games_missed=1,
    star_players_only=False
)

# Create treatment windows
panel = definer.create_treatment_windows(
    panel,
    treatment_col='injury_treatment',
    pre_window=3,
    post_window=3
)
```

**Output**: Additional columns:
- `injury_treatment`: Binary indicator (1 = treatment week)
- `post_injury`: Cumulative indicator (1 = post-treatment)
- `injury_intensity`: Continuous (games missed)
- `injury_treatment_pre_window`: Pre-treatment window indicator
- `injury_treatment_post_window`: Post-treatment window indicator

---

### 3. Confounder Identification (`confounder_identification.py`)

**Purpose**: Identify confounding variables and check covariate balance.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Confounder**: Variable affecting both treatment and outcome
- **Backdoor criterion**: Variables blocking all backdoor paths
- **Positivity/Overlap**: Treated and control units have similar covariate distributions
- **Balance**: Covariates are similar between groups (SMD < 0.1)

**Methods**:
- `identify_confounders()`: Statistical tests for confounding
- `get_minimal_adjustment_set()`: Minimal set for valid inference
- `check_positivity()`: Ensures overlap via propensity scores
- `compute_covariate_balance()`: Standardized mean differences
- `suggest_instrumental_variables()`: For unmeasured confounding
- `detect_colliders()`: Variables to NOT condition on

**Usage**:
```python
from causal.confounder_identification import ConfounderIdentifier

identifier = ConfounderIdentifier(alpha=0.05)

# Identify confounders
confounders = identifier.identify_confounders(
    df=panel,
    treatment_col='injury_treatment',
    outcome_col='stat_yards',
    candidate_confounders=[
        'player_ability_proxy',
        'team_quality',
        'opponent_defense_rank',
        'recent_usage'
    ]
)

# Get adjustment set
adjustment_set = identifier.get_minimal_adjustment_set(
    panel,
    'injury_treatment',
    'stat_yards'
)

# Check balance
balance = identifier.compute_covariate_balance(
    panel,
    'injury_treatment',
    adjustment_set
)
```

**Interpretation**:
- Variables with `is_confounder=True` should be adjusted for
- `abs_smd < 0.1`: Good balance
- `abs_smd < 0.25`: Acceptable balance
- `abs_smd > 0.25`: Poor balance (need adjustment)

---

### 4. Synthetic Control Method (`synthetic_control.py`)

**Purpose**: Estimate counterfactual outcomes by creating synthetic versions of treated units.

**Key Idea**:
- Treated unit experiences shock (injury, coaching change)
- Create "synthetic" version as weighted combination of control units
- Synthetic control mimics treated unit's pre-treatment trajectory
- Difference post-treatment = causal effect

**Applications**:
- **Player injury**: "What would yards be without injury?"
- **Coaching change**: "What would performance be with old coach?"
- **Trade impact**: "What would stats be on old team?"

**Methods Supported**:
- `optimization`: Constrained optimization (Abadie et al. 2010)
- `ridge`: Ridge regression with regularization
- `elastic_net`: Elastic net for sparse weights
- `nnls`: Non-negative least squares

**Usage**:
```python
from causal.synthetic_control import SyntheticControl

sc = SyntheticControl(method='optimization')

sc.fit(
    df=panel,
    treated_unit_id='player_123',
    unit_col='player_id',
    time_col='week',
    outcome_col='stat_yards',
    treatment_time=10  # Week 10
)

# Treatment effect
print(f"Average effect: {sc.treatment_effect_['average_effect']:.1f} yards")

# Top contributors to synthetic control
weights = sc.get_contribution_weights(top_n=5)
print(weights)

# Placebo test for significance
placebo = sc.placebo_test(
    df=panel,
    unit_col='player_id',
    time_col='week',
    outcome_col='stat_yards',
    treatment_time=10
)
print(f"P-value: {placebo['p_value']:.3f}")
```

**Output**:
- `treatment_effect_`: Dict with average, cumulative, and period-by-period effects
- `weights_`: Weights for each control unit
- `pre_treatment_fit_`: Quality of pre-treatment match (RMSE, MAE)
- Placebo p-value for statistical significance

---

### 5. Difference-in-Differences (`diff_in_diff.py`)

**Purpose**: Estimate treatment effects by comparing treated vs control groups over time.

**Key Formula**:
```
DiD = (Treated_post - Treated_pre) - (Control_post - Control_pre)
```

**Variants**:
1. **Standard 2×2 DiD**: One treatment event, two periods
2. **Staggered adoption**: Units treated at different times (TWFE)
3. **Event study**: Dynamic effects over time

**Assumptions**:
- **Parallel trends**: Treated and control would have followed parallel trajectories without treatment
- **No anticipation**: No effects before treatment
- **Stable composition**: Same units over time

**Usage**:
```python
from causal.diff_in_diff import DifferenceInDifferences

did = DifferenceInDifferences(cluster_var='team')

# Fit standard DiD
did.fit(
    df=panel,
    outcome_col='team_points',
    treatment_col='coaching_change',
    unit_col='team',
    time_col='week'
)

print(f"DiD estimate: {did.treatment_effect_['estimate']:.2f}")
print(f"P-value: {did.treatment_effect_['p_value']:.3f}")

# Test parallel trends assumption
pt_test = did.test_parallel_trends(
    df=panel,
    outcome_col='team_points',
    treatment_col='coaching_change',
    unit_col='team',
    time_col='week',
    pre_periods=3
)

if pt_test['passes']:
    print("✓ Parallel trends assumption supported")

# Event study for dynamic effects
event = did.event_study(
    df=panel,
    outcome_col='team_points',
    treatment_col='coaching_change',
    unit_col='team',
    time_col='week',
    leads=3,
    lags=5
)
```

**Applications**:
- **Coaching changes**: Compare team performance before/after vs control teams
- **Rule changes**: Compare affected vs unaffected teams
- **Player trades**: Compare performance on new vs old team
- **Strategy shifts**: Compare adopters vs non-adopters

---

### 6. Structural Causal Models (`structural_causal_models.py`)

**Purpose**: Represent causal relationships with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

**Key Concepts**:
- **DAG**: Nodes = variables, edges = causal relationships
- **Backdoor criterion**: Find minimal adjustment set to block confounding
- **d-separation**: Test conditional independence in DAGs
- **do-calculus**: Compute interventional distributions

**Methods**:
- `CausalDAG`: Build and manipulate causal graphs
- `find_backdoor_adjustment_set()`: Identify confounders to adjust for
- `is_d_separated()`: Test conditional independence
- `create_nfl_rushing_dag()`: Example DAG for rushing performance
- `create_coaching_change_dag()`: Example DAG for coaching effects

**Usage**:
```python
from causal.structural_causal_models import CausalDAG

# Build custom DAG
dag = CausalDAG()

# Add causal relationships
dag.add_edge('player_ability', 'carries')
dag.add_edge('player_ability', 'rushing_yards')
dag.add_edge('team_quality', 'carries')
dag.add_edge('team_quality', 'rushing_yards')
dag.add_edge('opponent_defense', 'rushing_yards')
dag.add_edge('carries', 'rushing_yards')  # Treatment → Outcome

# Find what to adjust for
adjustment_set = dag.find_backdoor_adjustment_set(
    treatment='carries',
    outcome='rushing_yards'
)
print(f"Adjust for: {adjustment_set}")

# Test conditional independence
is_independent = dag.is_d_separated(
    X={'carries'},
    Y={'opponent_defense'},
    Z={'team_quality', 'player_ability'}
)
```

**Pre-built DAGs**:
- `create_nfl_rushing_dag()`: Rushing performance causal model
- `create_coaching_change_dag()`: Coaching change effects with mediation

---

### 7. Model Integration (`model_integration.py`)

**Purpose**: Connect causal inference to BNN and prop prediction models.

**Integration Points**:
1. **Causal features**: Add deconfounded features to model inputs
2. **Treatment priors**: Use causal estimates as Bayesian priors
3. **Shock adjustments**: Adjust predictions for injuries, coaching changes
4. **Counterfactuals**: Generate "what if" predictions
5. **Betting edges**: Enhance edge calculation with causal estimates

**Key Methods**:
- `add_causal_features()`: Engineer causal features for training
- `estimate_treatment_effect_priors()`: Generate priors for BNN
- `adjust_prediction_for_shock()`: Adjust predictions for events
- `generate_counterfactual_prediction()`: "What if" predictions
- `compute_betting_edge_with_causality()`: Edge with causal adjustments
- `identify_high_leverage_events()`: Find games where causal inference adds most value

**Usage**:
```python
from causal.model_integration import CausalModelIntegrator

integrator = CausalModelIntegrator(db_connection)

# Add causal features to training data
train_df = integrator.add_causal_features(
    train_df,
    feature_set='propensity'  # or 'standard', 'counterfactual'
)

# Get treatment effect prior for BNN
injury_prior = integrator.estimate_treatment_effect_priors(
    treatment_type='injury',
    outcome='rushing_yards'
)
# Returns: {'prior_mean': -15.0, 'prior_std': 8.0}

# Adjust prediction for injury shock
base_pred = 85.0  # BNN prediction
adjusted = integrator.adjust_prediction_for_shock(
    base_prediction=base_pred,
    shock_type='injury',
    shock_magnitude=1.0
)
# Returns adjusted prediction with uncertainty

# Compute betting edge with causal adjustment
edge = integrator.compute_betting_edge_with_causality(
    prediction=base_pred,
    market_line=72.5,
    causal_adjustments={'injury': 0.5}
)

# Identify high-leverage games
high_leverage = integrator.identify_high_leverage_events(
    upcoming_games_df
)
```

---

### 8. Validation & Backtesting (`validation.py`)

**Purpose**: Validate causal estimates and backtest betting performance.

**Validation Methods**:

1. **Placebo Tests**: Apply methods to random treatments (should find null effects)
2. **Sensitivity Analysis**: How robust are results to unmeasured confounding?
3. **Cross-Validation**: Out-of-sample treatment effect estimation
4. **Event Study**: Dynamic effects around treatment events
5. **Betting Backtest**: Compare ROI with/without causal adjustments

**Usage**:
```python
from causal.validation import CausalValidator, CausalBacktester

validator = CausalValidator()

# Placebo test
placebo = validator.placebo_test(
    estimator=did,
    df=panel,
    n_placebos=100
)
print(f"Placebo p-value: {placebo['p_value']:.3f}")

# Sensitivity analysis
sensitivity = validator.sensitivity_analysis(
    estimator=did,
    df=panel,
    confounder_strength_range=[0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
)

# Cross-validation
cv = validator.cross_validate_treatment_effects(
    df=panel,
    estimator_class=DifferenceInDifferences,
    outcome_col='stat_yards',
    treatment_col='injury_treatment',
    unit_col='player_id',
    time_col='week',
    n_folds=5
)

# Backtesting
backtester = CausalBacktester()
results = backtester.backtest_predictions(
    df=test_df,
    baseline_pred_col='baseline_pred',
    causal_pred_col='causal_pred',
    actual_col='actual_yards',
    market_line_col='vegas_line'
)

print(f"MAE improvement: {results['mae_improvement_pct']:.1f}%")
print(f"ROI improvement: {results['betting']['roi_improvement']:+.1f}%")
```

```

### Workflow 2: Counterfactual Player Valuation with Synthetic Control

# Scenario: Star RB gets injured, estimate impact
injured_player = 'derrick_henry'
injury_week = 8

sc = SyntheticControl(method='optimization')
sc.fit(
    df=panel,
    treated_unit_id=injured_player,
    unit_col='player_id',
    time_col='week',
    outcome_col='stat_yards',
    treatment_time=injury_week
)

# Counterfactual: What would yards be without injury?
effect = sc.treatment_effect_['average_effect']
counterfactual_avg = panel[panel['player_id'] == injured_player]['stat_yards'].mean() - effect

print(f"Actual avg (injured): {panel[panel['player_id'] == injured_player]['stat_yards'].mean():.1f}")
print(f"Counterfactual avg (healthy): {counterfactual_avg:.1f}")
print(f"Causal impact: {effect:.1f} yards/game")

# Statistical significance
placebo = sc.placebo_test(
    df=panel,
    unit_col='player_id',
    time_col='week',
    outcome_col='stat_yards',
    treatment_time=injury_week
)

print(f"P-value: {placebo['p_value']:.3f}")
print(f"Rank: {placebo['rank']}/{placebo['total']}")
```

### Workflow 3: Integrate Causal Adjustments into Betting Pipeline

```python
from causal.model_integration import CausalModelIntegrator

integrator = CausalModelIntegrator(db_connection)

# Get upcoming games
upcoming = get_upcoming_games()  # Your function

# Identify high-leverage situations
high_leverage = integrator.identify_high_leverage_events(upcoming)

for _, game in high_leverage.iterrows():
    if game['causal_leverage_score'] > 3.0:
        # Get BNN prediction
        base_pred = get_bnn_prediction(game['player_id'])  # Your function
        market_line = game['vegas_line']

        # Apply causal adjustment
        if game['injury_treatment']:
            adjusted = integrator.adjust_prediction_for_shock(
                base_prediction=base_pred,
                shock_type='injury',
                shock_magnitude=1.0
            )

            # Compute edge
            edge = integrator.compute_betting_edge_with_causality(
                prediction=adjusted['adjusted_prediction'],
                market_line=market_line
            )

            if abs(edge['edge']) > 5.0:
                print(f"⚠ HIGH EDGE OPPORTUNITY:")
                print(f"  Player: {game['player_name']}")
                print(f"  Base pred: {base_pred:.1f}")
                print(f"  Adjusted: {adjusted['adjusted_prediction']:.1f}")
                print(f"  Market: {market_line:.1f}")
                print(f"  Edge: {edge['edge']:+.1f} yards")
```

## Integration with Existing Models

### BNN Integration

**Adding Causal Features**:
```python
# In train_bnn_rushing.py

from causal.model_integration import CausalModelIntegrator

integrator = CausalModelIntegrator(db_connection)

# Add causal features to training data
train_df = integrator.add_causal_features(
    train_df,
    feature_set='propensity'
)

# Now includes: deconfounded_carries, injury_propensity, ipw_weight, etc.
```

**Using Causal Priors**:
```python
# In BNN model definition

injury_prior = integrator.estimate_treatment_effect_priors('injury', 'rushing_yards')

with pm.Model() as model:
    # Use causal estimate as prior
    injury_effect = pm.Normal(
        'injury_effect',
        mu=injury_prior['prior_mean'],
        sigma=injury_prior['prior_std']
    )

    # Rest of model...
```

### Dashboard Integration

Add causal insights to Streamlit dashboard:

```python
# In dashboard/app.py

st.header("Causal Analysis")

# Show high-leverage events
high_leverage = integrator.identify_high_leverage_events(upcoming_games)

st.subheader("High-Leverage Events (Causal Edge Opportunities)")
st.dataframe(high_leverage[high_leverage['causal_leverage_score'] > 2.0])

# Show counterfactual analysis for key players
st.subheader("Counterfactual Player Valuation")

injured_players = get_injured_players()  # Your function
for player in injured_players:
    effect = estimate_injury_effect(player)  # Your function

    st.metric(
        label=f"{player['name']} (Injured)",
        value=f"{player['actual_avg']:.1f} yards/game",
        delta=f"{effect:.1f} vs healthy",
        delta_color="inverse"
    )
```

---

## Use Cases for Betting

### 1. Shock Event Betting

**Problem**: Vegas lines don't fully adjust for sudden events
**Solution**: Use causal estimates to compute true adjustment

```python
# Derrick Henry returns from injury this week
# Market hasn't fully adjusted

base_pred = 82.0  # BNN prediction
vegas_line = 75.5

# Apply injury return adjustment
adjusted = integrator.adjust_prediction_for_shock(
    base_prediction=base_pred,
    shock_type='injury',
    shock_magnitude=0.7  # Still recovering
)

edge = adjusted['adjusted_prediction'] - vegas_line
# If edge > 5 yards: BET OVER
```

### 2. Coaching Change Opportunities

**Problem**: Hard to predict coaching change effects
**Solution**: Use DiD estimates from historical coaching changes

```python
# Panthers fire coach week 11
# Use historical estimates

coaching_effect = integrator.estimate_treatment_effect_priors(
    'coaching_change',
    'team_points'
)

# Adjust team total prediction
adjusted_total = base_total + coaching_effect['prior_mean']

# Compare to market total
if abs(adjusted_total - market_total) > 3.0:
    # BETTING OPPORTUNITY
```

### 3. Synthetic Control for Player Props

**Problem**: New teammate, trade, or role change - limited data
**Solution**: Use synthetic control to estimate counterfactual performance

```python
# Christian McCaffrey traded to 49ers
# What's his expected performance in new system?

sc = SyntheticControl()
sc.fit(
    df=panel,
    treated_unit_id='christian_mccaffrey',
    unit_col='player_id',
    time_col='week',
    outcome_col='stat_yards',
    treatment_time=trade_week
)

# Synthetic control shows what performance would be on old team
# Actual - Synthetic = trade effect
trade_effect = sc.treatment_effect_['average_effect']

# Adjust predictions going forward
adjusted_pred = base_pred + trade_effect
```

---

---

## Limitations and Assumptions

### Key Assumptions

1. **No unobserved confounding** (after adjustment)
   - Validity depends on measuring all confounders
   - Use sensitivity analysis to assess robustness

2. **Parallel trends** (DiD)
   - Treated and control would have followed parallel paths
   - Test with pre-treatment data

3. **SUTVA** (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption)
   - Treatment of one unit doesn't affect others
   - May be violated in team sports (spillover effects)

4. **Positivity** (overlap)
   - All units have positive probability of treatment
   - Check with propensity score diagnostics

### Current Limitations

1. **Sample size**: Small samples for rare events (coaching changes)
2. **Treatment heterogeneity**: Effects may vary by player, team, context
3. **Time-varying confounding**: Some confounders change over time
4. **Measurement error**: Injuries, usage patterns not perfectly measured

### Future Enhancements

1. **Doubly-robust estimation**: Combine propensity scores with outcome regression
2. **Instrumental variables**: For unmeasured confounding
3. **Machine learning methods**: Causal forests, double ML
4. **Mediation analysis**: Decompose direct vs indirect effects
5. **Dynamic treatment regimes**: Optimal sequential decisions
