# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Your Subagent System

Use this checklist to onboard yourself (or team members) to the three-agent coordination model.

---

## âœ… Day 1: Orientation

### Everyone (15-30 minutes)

- [ ] Read [SUBAGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](SUBAGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) for overview
- [ ] Read [SUBAGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](SUBAGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md) and bookmark it
- [ ] Review [ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md](ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md) to visualize the system
- [ ] Decide which agent role you're taking (DevOps/ETL/Research)

### Agent-Specific (30-45 minutes)

**If you're DevOps**:
- [ ] Read [SUBAGENT_DEVOPS.md](SUBAGENT_DEVOPS.md) thoroughly
- [ ] Review the SOP section for common tasks
- [ ] Check your file ownership areas
- [ ] Test: Can you start the database with `docker compose up -d pg`?

**If you're ETL**:
- [ ] Read [SUBAGENT_ETL.md](SUBAGENT_ETL.md) thoroughly
- [ ] Review the pipeline configurations in `etl/config/`
- [ ] Check your file ownership areas
- [ ] Test: Can you run a simple data validation check?

**If you're Research/Analytics**:
- [ ] Read [SUBAGENT_RESEARCH_ANALYTICS.md](SUBAGENT_RESEARCH_ANALYTICS.md) thoroughly
- [ ] Review the model structure in `py/backtest/` and `R/features/`
- [ ] Check your file ownership areas
- [ ] Test: Can you generate a feature dataset or run a simple backtest?

---

## âœ… Day 2: Coordination & Workflows

### Morning (30 minutes)

- [ ] Read [SUBAGENT_COORDINATION.md](SUBAGENT_COORDINATION.md)
- [ ] Understand the handoff system
- [ ] Review handoff templates in `docs/agent_context/handoffs/templates/`
- [ ] Create the directory structure:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p docs/agent_context/handoffs/active
  mkdir -p docs/agent_context/handoffs/archive/$(date +%Y-%m)
  ```

### Afternoon (1 hour)

**Practice a Handoff**:
- [ ] Copy an appropriate handoff template
- [ ] Fill it out for a real (or practice) scenario
- [ ] Save it to `handoffs/active/`
- [ ] Review it - is all info complete?

**Review Workflows**:
- [ ] Trace through one end-to-end workflow relevant to you:
  - DevOps: Schema change workflow
  - ETL: Weekly data update workflow
  - Research: Model deployment workflow
- [ ] Identify where handoffs occur
- [ ] Note any questions or unclear areas

## âœ… Week 1: Active Participation

### Daily Stand-Up Practice

Create a daily stand-up log (e.g., `logs/daily_standup.md`):

```markdown

## âœ… Week 2: Refinement

### Weekly Planning Session

Hold your first planning session (can be solo if you're all agents):

- [ ] Review previous week's metrics
- [ ] Discuss upcoming milestones
- [ ] Identify cross-agent dependencies
- [ ] Allocate priorities
- [ ] Document in planning notes

**Template**:
```markdown
# Weekly Planning - Week of YYYY-MM-DD

## Previous Week Review
- What shipped
- Blockers encountered
- Metrics summary

## This Week's Priorities
- DevOps: [top 3 priorities]
- ETL: [top 3 priorities]
- Research: [top 3 priorities]

## Cross-Agent Dependencies
- [Agent A] needs [X] from [Agent B] by [date]

## Decisions Made
- [Decision]: [Rationale]

## Action Items
- [ ] [Action] - [Owner] - [Due Date]
```

### Coordination Refinement

- [ ] Review all handoffs from Week 1
- [ ] Time how long each handoff took
- [ ] Identify any information gaps
- [ ] Update templates if needed
- [ ] Document lessons learned

### Process Improvements

- [ ] What worked well? (Keep doing)
- [ ] What was frustrating? (Fix or improve)
- [ ] What was unclear? (Document better)

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "I'm overwhelmed by all this documentation"
â†’ Start with just the Quick Reference. Read your agent handbook in chunks. You don't need to memorize everything.

### "The templates feel too formal"
â†’ They're starting points. Simplify them if needed, but don't skip handoffs entirely. Even a simple message with key info is better than nothing.

### "I'm the only person, doing all three roles feels weird"
â†’ That's okay! The separation helps you context-switch. When you "switch agents," you change your mindset and focus. It prevents mixing concerns.

### "A workflow doesn't match our reality"
â†’ Adapt it! This system is a starting point. Customize to your needs. Just document what you change and why.

### "I found a better way to do something"
â†’ Excellent! Update the relevant handbook or coordination guide. Share in retrospective. Help future you (or others) benefit.

## ðŸ“Š Success Indicators

You'll know the system is working when:

âœ… **Clarity**: You always know which "agent hat" you're wearing and what you should focus on

âœ… **Communication**: Handoffs have all the info you need without back-and-forth clarifications

âœ… **Efficiency**: You spend more time doing work and less time deciding what to work on

âœ… **Quality**: Fewer surprises, better validation, more reproducible results

âœ… **Progress**: Consistent advancement on dissertation, models, and infrastructure

âœ… **Confidence**: You trust the process and feel less overwhelmed

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Next Action

**Right now, choose ONE task**:

- [ ] Read the Quick Reference (15 min)
- [ ] Read your agent handbook (30 min)
- [ ] Create a handoff for something you're working on (15 min)
- [ ] Write today's stand-up entry (5 min)

**Don't try to do everything at once. Start small, build habits, iterate.**

---

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

- **Unclear documentation**: Note it in your stand-up or retro, then improve it
- **Process not working**: Adapt it! Document your changes
- **Stuck on a problem**: Review the relevant agent handbook for SOPs
- **Need human guidance**: You're a human reading this! Trust your judgment

**You're ready to start. Pick your first task above and begin! ðŸš€**

Good luck with your NFL analytics project!
