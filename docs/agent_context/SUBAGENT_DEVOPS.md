## üõ† Standard Operating Procedures

### SOP-001: Database Migration
```bash
# 1. Create migration file
cat > db/migrations/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)_description.sql <<EOF
-- Migration: Add new feature columns
-- Author: DevOps Agent
-- Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

BEGIN;

-- Add columns
ALTER TABLE staging.team_stats 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS new_feature NUMERIC(10,4);

-- Create indices
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_team_stats_new_feature 
ON staging.team_stats(new_feature);

COMMIT;
EOF

# 2. Test on dev database
bash scripts/dev/reset_db.sh  # Fresh start
psql $DATABASE_URL -f db/migrations/$(ls -t db/migrations/ | head -1)

# 3. Notify ETL Agent with schema changes
# 4. Apply to production during maintenance window
```

### SOP-002: Emergency Database Rollback
```bash
# 1. Stop all ETL processes
# 2. Restore from last known good backup
pg_restore -d devdb01 /path/to/backup/latest.dump

# 3. Notify all agents of rollback
# 4. Investigate root cause
# 5. Document incident in docs/operations/incidents/
```

### SOP-003: New Service Deployment
```bash
# 1. Update docker-compose.yml
# 2. Test locally
docker compose up --build <service>

# 3. Document environment variables in .env.example
# 4. Update docs/setup/README.md
# 5. Notify other agents of new capabilities
```

### SOP-004: Performance Investigation
```sql
-- 1. Check slow queries
SELECT query, calls, mean_exec_time, max_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- 2. Check table bloat
SELECT schemaname, tablename, 
       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename))
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;

-- 3. Check missing indices
SELECT schemaname, tablename, attname
FROM pg_stats
WHERE schemaname = 'mart'
  AND n_distinct > 100
  AND correlation < 0.5;

-- 4. Document findings and recommendations
```

## üìû Escalation Path

1. **Routine Issues**: Handle independently, document in logs
2. **Service Degradation**: Notify affected agents, implement fix
3. **Data Loss Risk**: Immediate escalation to all agents + human
4. **Security Incident**: Stop all services, notify human, preserve logs
5. **Unclear Requirements**: Request clarification from requesting agent

---

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Automate Everything**: If you do it twice, script it
2. **Document Changes**: Every migration needs comments and changelog entry
3. **Test Locally First**: Never test in production
4. **Monitor Actively**: Don't wait for others to report issues
5. **Communicate Proactively**: Notify before changes, not after
6. **Version Control**: All infrastructure code in git
7. **Backup Religiously**: Assume disaster will happen
8. **Security First**: Principle of least privilege for all access

---

## üîÑ Daily Checklist

- [ ] Check database health and query performance
- [ ] Review overnight logs for errors or warnings
- [ ] Verify backup completion
- [ ] Monitor disk space utilization
- [ ] Check for pending security updates
- [ ] Review ETL pipeline success metrics
