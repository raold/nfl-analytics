# Database Gap Analysis & Backfill Plan

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Database:** devdb01 @ localhost:5544  
**Analysis Period:** 1999-2024 (26 seasons)

---

## Executive Summary

Your database has **excellent core coverage** (1999-2024) with play-by-play data and game results. However, it's missing many **high-value features** available in nflfastR/nflverse that could significantly improve model performance.

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETE:** Game results (6,969 games), play-by-play (1.2M plays), EPA calculations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **GAPS:** Advanced PBP features, roster data, player tracking, situational stats
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **SPARSE:** Weather (93.4% coverage 2020+), odds history (limited), moneylines (missing pre-2006)
- ‚ùå **MISSING:** WP (win probability), success rate, air yards, YAC, personnel groupings, roster data

**Estimated Impact:** Backfilling recommended features could add **+3-5% model accuracy** and **+1-2% ROI**.

## 2. Gap Analysis by Category

### üî¥ CRITICAL GAPS (High Value, Should Backfill)

#### Gap 1: Advanced Play-by-Play Features
**What's Missing:**
- Win Probability (WP) and WP added (WPA)
- Success rate indicators
- Air yards, YAC (yards after catch), complete air yards (air_yards + YAC)
- CPOE (completion percentage over expected)
- Expected points added for rush/pass separately
- Down conversions, first downs
- Personnel groupings (11 personnel, 12 personnel, etc.)
- Play type detail (run direction, pass depth, route concept)
- Player IDs for QB, RB, WR, targeted receiver

**Impact:** 
- WP critical for late-game situational modeling
- Air yards/YAC predict passing efficiency better than raw EPA
- Success rate complements EPA (more stable metric)
- **Expected Improvement:** +2-3% accuracy, +0.8-1.2% ROI

**nflfastR Columns to Add:** (~50 high-value columns)
```
wp, wpa, vegas_wp, vegas_wpa, success, yards_gained, 
air_yards, yards_after_catch, comp_air_epa, comp_yac_epa,
cpoe, first_down, goal_to_go, qb_scramble, run_location, 
run_gap, pass_length, pass_location, complete_pass, 
passer_player_id, rusher_player_id, receiver_player_id,
tackler_1_player_id, interception_player_id, fumble_player_id,
penalty, penalty_team, penalty_yards, no_huddle, qb_dropback, 
qb_kneel, qb_spike, two_point_attempt, field_goal_result,
kick_distance, extra_point_result, touchdown, td_team,
posteam_score, defteam_score, score_differential,
posteam_score_post, defteam_score_post, no_score_prob,
opp_fg_prob, opp_safety_prob, opp_td_prob, fg_prob, 
safety_prob, td_prob, extra_point_prob, two_point_conversion_prob
```

**Backfill Method:** `nflfastR::load_pbp(seasons = 1999:2024)` ‚Üí select/rename ‚Üí upsert to `plays`

---

#### Gap 2: Roster & Player Data
**What's Missing:**
- Player names, positions, team rosters by week
- QB experience, passer rating, career stats
- Injury designations tied to player IDs
- Snap counts, routes run, targets
- Depth chart positions

**Impact:**
- QB identity critical (rookie vs veteran vs backup)
- Positional matchups (CB vs WR quality)
- Snap counts predict player impact
- **Expected Improvement:** +1-2% accuracy, +0.5-1.0% ROI

**nflfastR/nflreadr Sources:**
- `nflreadr::load_rosters(seasons = 1999:2024)` ‚Üí players, positions, team
- `nflreadr::load_depth_charts(seasons = 2001:2024)` ‚Üí depth chart
- `nflreadr::load_snap_counts(seasons = 2012:2024)` ‚Üí offensive/defensive snaps
- `nflfastR::fast_scraper_roster(seasons = 1999:2024)` ‚Üí comprehensive roster

**Backfill Method:** Create `players` and `rosters` tables, link via player_id to plays

---

#### Gap 3: Pre-Snap Context
**What's Missing:**
- Personnel groupings (11, 12, 21, etc.)
- Formation (shotgun, under center, pistol)
- Number of pass rushers
- Men in box
- Defenders in box
- Motion indicators

**Impact:**
- Personnel predicts play type (11 personnel = 75% pass)
- Shotgun vs under center affects success rate
- Defensive alignment affects EPA
- **Expected Improvement:** +0.5-1.0% accuracy

**nflfastR Columns:**
```
shotgun, no_huddle, qb_dropback, offense_formation, 
offense_personnel, defenders_in_box, number_of_pass_rushers,
men_in_box, offense_players_on_field, defense_players_on_field
```

**Backfill Method:** Available in full nflfastR PBP data (2016+), limited before

---

### üü° MODERATE GAPS (Medium Value, Consider Backfilling)

#### Gap 4: Game-Level Stats
**What's Missing:**
- Time of possession (TOP)
- Turnovers (fumbles, interceptions by team)
- Penalties (count and yards)
- Third down conversions
- Red zone efficiency
- Sacks allowed/recorded

**Impact:**
- TOP correlates with run-heavy game scripts
- Turnover differential huge predictor
- Penalty yards affect spread outcomes
- **Expected Improvement:** +0.5-1.0% accuracy

**nflfastR Source:** Aggregate from plays table or use `nflreadr::load_schedules()` metadata

**Backfill Method:** Calculate from existing plays + augment from nflreadr schedules

---

#### Gap 5: Stadium & Venue Data
**What's Missing:**
- Stadium name
- Roof type (dome, retractable, open)
- Surface type (grass, turf, field turf)
- Altitude
- Latitude/longitude for weather API

**Impact:**
- Dome games eliminate weather factors
- Turf affects injury rates and speed
- Altitude impacts kicking
- **Expected Improvement:** +0.3-0.5% accuracy (complements weather features)

**nflfastR Source:** `nflreadr::load_schedules()` has `roof` and `surface` columns

**Backfill Method:** Join schedules data to games table, add columns

---

#### Gap 6: Historical Weather (Pre-2020)
**What's Missing:**
- Weather for 1999-2019 games (4,969 games = 71% of total)

**Impact:**
- Weather affects totals significantly
- Wind impacts passing games
- Cold/precipitation affects ball handling
- **Expected Improvement:** Enables models on full historical data

**Backfill Method:** 
- Use nflreadr::load_schedules() `weather` field (text descriptions)
- Parse descriptions for temp/wind/conditions
- Backfill Meteostat for outdoor stadiums with lat/lon

---

#### Gap 7: Moneylines (Pre-2006)
**What's Missing:**
- Moneylines for 1999-2005 games (1,365 games missing)
- Some games 2006-2009 have partial coverage

**Impact:**
- Moneylines enable money management strategies
- Kelly criterion sizing requires moneylines
- **Expected Improvement:** Enables live betting simulation on historical data

**Backfill Method:** 
- Check if nflreadr::load_schedules() has historical moneylines
- Otherwise scrape from Pro Football Reference or Covers.com archives

---

### üü¢ MINOR GAPS (Lower Priority, Nice-to-Have)

#### Gap 8: Player Tracking Data
**What's Missing:**
- Next Gen Stats (NGS) tracking: speed, separation, acceleration
- Route tracking, QB time to throw
- Defender proximity

**Impact:**
- NGS data highly predictive but only available 2018+
- Not essential for game-level modeling
- **Expected Improvement:** +0.2-0.5% for in-play markets

**Backfill Method:** `nflreadr::load_nextgen_stats()` (2018+)

---

#### Gap 9: Playoff Context (Currently Empty)
**What's Missing:**
- Playoff probabilities by week
- Desperation indicators
- Tanking/resting signals

**Status:** Table exists but nflseedR script needs fixing (see FEATURE_ENGINEERING_COMPLETE.md)

**Impact:** +1.0-1.5% accuracy for late-season games (weeks 15-18)

**Backfill Method:** Fix nflseedR integration or use alternative playoff calculator

---

#### Gap 10: Coaching & Front Office Data
**What's Missing:**
- Head coach names/experience
- Offensive/defensive coordinators
- GM tenure
- Coaching changes

**Impact:**
- Coaching quality affects game outcomes
- Coordinator changes affect scheme
- **Expected Improvement:** +0.2-0.4% accuracy

**Backfill Method:** `nflreadr::load_teams()` has coaching data (2002+)

| **Sharpe Ratio** | 0.89 | 0.95-1.05 | +6.7% to +18.0% |
| **Feature Count** | ~25 | ~80 | +220% |
| **Data Completeness** | 85% | 97% | +12% |

### Qualitative Improvements

1. **Better situational modeling** - WP enables late-game context
2. **Player-specific predictions** - QB/RB/WR identity matters
3. **Personnel-aware models** - 11 vs 12 vs 21 personnel
4. **Improved calibration** - Success rate complements EPA
5. **Historical depth** - Full 26-season dataset usable

## 7. Storage & Performance Considerations

### Disk Space Requirements

| Data | Current Size | After Backfill | Increase |
|------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| plays table | 157 MB | ~450 MB | +187% |
| New tables (players, rosters) | 0 | ~25 MB | +25 MB |
| Indexes | ~50 MB | ~120 MB | +70 MB |
| **TOTAL** | ~250 MB | ~620 MB | +370 MB |

**Verdict:** Manageable increase (~600 MB total for core tables)

### Query Performance

- Added indexes on player_id, team, season will maintain fast queries
- Materialized views should be refreshed after backfill
- Expect 10-20% slower queries due to wider tables, but still < 1 sec for game lookups

## 8. Validation Checklist

After running backfill scripts, verify:

- [ ] plays table has WP, success, air_yards columns
- [ ] plays table has player_id columns (passer, rusher, receiver)
- [ ] players table has ~50K unique players
- [ ] rosters table has data for all seasons 1999-2024
- [ ] games table has roof, surface, stadium for all games
- [ ] games table has turnovers/penalties calculated
- [ ] No NULL values in critical columns (or expected NULLs documented)
- [ ] Sample queries return sensible data
- [ ] Materialized views refreshed successfully
- [ ] Python harness can load new features
- [ ] Model training runs without errors

---

## 9. Rollback Plan

If backfill causes issues:

```sql
-- Backup before starting
pg_dump -h localhost -p 5544 -U dro devdb01 > backup_before_backfill.sql

-- Rollback: drop added columns
ALTER TABLE plays DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS wp;
ALTER TABLE plays DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS wpa;
-- ... (drop all added columns)

-- Restore from backup if needed
psql -h localhost -p 5544 -U dro devdb01 < backup_before_backfill.sql
```

## 10. Next Steps After Backfill

1. **Retrain models with new features**
2. **Run OOS backtest to validate improvement**
3. **Update dissertation tables with new results**
4. **Create feature importance analysis**
5. **Document new features in methods chapter**
6. **Implement feature selection (LASSO/RFE) to find optimal subset**
7. **Explore player-specific models (QB EPA, WR separation, etc.)**
