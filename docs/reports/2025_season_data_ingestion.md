## Technical Details

### Column Name Changes (2025 vs Historical)
nflreadr updated column names in 2025 play-by-play data:

| Historical | 2025  | Impact                              |
|-----------|-------|-------------------------------------|
| `quarter` | `qtr` | Fixed in ingestion script           |
| 320 cols  | 372   | More detailed play-level metrics    |

**Solution**: Updated `scripts/ingest_2025_season.R` to handle column name mapping with fallback logic:
```r
quarter = if("qtr" %in% available_cols) qtr 
          else if("quarter" %in% available_cols) quarter 
          else NA_integer_
```

### Ingestion Process
**Script**: `scripts/ingest_2025_season.R`

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Load schedules → `games` table (272 games upserted)
2. ✅ Load play-by-play → `plays` table (11,239 plays inserted)
3. ✅ Load rosters → `players` + `rosters` tables (3,074 entries)
4. ✅ Calculate turnovers/penalties from plays (272 games updated)
5. ✅ Update `mart.team_epa` (130 new records)
6. ✅ Refresh materialized views (3 views refreshed)

**Execution Time**: ~4 seconds  
**Log File**: `logs/ingest_2025_fixed_20251004_094258.log`

### Issues Resolved
1. **Column name mismatch**: Fixed `quarter` → `qtr` mapping
2. **Namespace conflict**: Added explicit `dplyr::` prefixes to avoid masking
3. **Python environment**: Configured venv and installed dependencies

## Validation Checks

### Data Quality
```sql
-- 2025 Games loaded correctly
SELECT season, COUNT(*), MIN(week), MAX(week), 
       SUM(CASE WHEN home_score IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed
FROM games WHERE season = 2025 GROUP BY season;

Result: 272 games, weeks 1-18, 65 completed ✓

-- 2025 Plays loaded correctly  
SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(DISTINCT game_id) 
FROM plays WHERE game_id LIKE '2025%';

Result: 11,239 plays from 65 games ✓

-- 2025 Rosters loaded correctly
SELECT COUNT(*), MIN(week), MAX(week) 
FROM rosters WHERE season = 2025;

Result: 3,074 entries, weeks 1-5 ✓
```

### Sample Game Data
```
game_id          week  matchup       score  away_to  home_to  QB matchup
