## Data Quality Validation Checklist

After all scripts complete, verify:

- [ ] plays table has 66 columns (was 11)
- [ ] plays table size ~450 MB (was 157 MB)
- [ ] WP column populated for 98%+ of plays
- [ ] success column populated for 98%+ of plays
- [ ] player_id columns populated for relevant plays
- [ ] players table has ~50K unique players
- [ ] rosters table has data for all 26 seasons
- [ ] games table has roof/surface for all games
- [ ] games table has QB names for 95%+ of games
- [ ] Turnovers calculated correctly (fumbles + INTs)
- [ ] No unexpected NULL values
- [ ] Materialized views refresh without errors
- [ ] Python harness can query new features

## Storage Impact

### Disk Space

| Component | Before | After | Increase |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| plays table | 157 MB | ~450 MB | +293 MB |
| games table | 1.2 MB | ~2 MB | +0.8 MB |
| players table | 0 | ~8 MB | +8 MB |
| rosters table | 0 | ~18 MB | +18 MB |
| Indexes | 50 MB | ~120 MB | +70 MB |
| **TOTAL** | ~250 MB | ~620 MB | **+370 MB** |

**Verdict:** Manageable increase. 620 MB is trivial for modern systems.

### Query Performance

**Expected Changes:**
- SELECT queries: 10-20% slower due to wider rows
- Filtered queries: Faster with new indexes on player_id, season, etc.
- Aggregations: Slightly slower but still sub-second for game-level
- JOIN performance: Improved with proper foreign keys

**Mitigation:**
- Added indexes on key columns (player_id, season, team)
- Materialized views cache common aggregations
- Consider partitioning plays table by season if needed (not urgent)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback procedure:

```bash
# 1. Create backup BEFORE backfill (should have done this)
pg_dump -h localhost -p 5544 -U dro devdb01 > backup_pre_backfill.sql

# 2. If needed, drop added columns
psql "postgresql://dro:sicillionbillions@localhost:5544/devdb01" <<EOF
-- Drop added columns from plays
ALTER TABLE plays DROP COLUMN wp;
ALTER TABLE plays DROP COLUMN wpa;
-- ... (repeat for all 55 columns)

-- Drop new tables
DROP TABLE rosters CASCADE;
DROP TABLE players CASCADE;

-- Restore games table columns (if needed)
ALTER TABLE games DROP COLUMN stadium;
-- ... (repeat for all 27 columns)
EOF

# 3. Full restore from backup (nuclear option)
dropdb -h localhost -p 5544 -U dro devdb01
createdb -h localhost -p 5544 -U dro devdb01
psql -h localhost -p 5544 -U dro devdb01 < backup_pre_backfill.sql
```
