# Weather Infrastructure Assessment & Recommendations

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Analysis Period**: 2020-2025 (1,408 games, 1,306 with weather data)
**Scope**: Comprehensive audit of weather data collection, feature engineering, and predictive value

---

## Executive Summary

Weather infrastructure is **technically sound but provides minimal predictive value**. Despite 92.7% coverage and comprehensive feature engineering (6 derived features, interaction terms, copulas), rigorous statistical testing reveals:

- **Wind**: r=0.004, p=0.90 (NO effect on scoring)
- **Temperature**: r=0.055, p=0.08 (NO significant effect)
- **Extreme conditions**: NO significant impact on totals or spreads
- **Model improvement**: +0.4% accuracy (XGBoost), -0.7% (GLM)

**Conclusion**: Weather variance exists but does NOT translate to predictable scoring patterns at NFL scale.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working Well

### 1. Data Ingestion Pipeline (`py/weather_meteostat.py`)

**Strengths**:
- 92.7% coverage (1,306/1,408 games) for 2020-present
- 40+ stadium coordinates with nearest-station matching via Meteostat API
- Hourly granularity with ¬±3 hour window around kickoff
- Batch processing (100 records/write) with error handling
- Clean separation: domes excluded automatically

**Raw Features Collected**:
```python
{
    "temp_c": "Temperature (Celsius)",
    "rh": "Relative humidity (%)",
    "wind_kph": "Wind speed (km/h)",
    "pressure_hpa": "Atmospheric pressure (hPa)",
    "precip_mm": "Precipitation (mm)"
}
```

### 2. Feature Engineering (`db/migrations/003_mart_game_weather.sql`)

**Derived Features**:
```sql
-- Normalized features
temp_extreme = ABS(temp_c - 15)          -- Deviation from optimal temp
wind_penalty = wind_kph / 10.0           -- 0-5 scale for modeling

-- Binary flags
has_precip = (precip_mm > 0)             -- Any precipitation
is_dome = (team IN dome_list)            -- Indoor game

-- Interaction terms
wind_precip_interaction = wind_penalty √ó has_precip
temp_wind_interaction = temp_extreme √ó wind_penalty
```

**Design Quality**: Clean, well-documented, uses domain knowledge (15¬∞C optimal temp based on NFL averages).

### 3. Scientific Validation

**Wind Hypothesis Testing** (`py/analysis/wind_impact_totals.py`):
- ‚úÖ Rigorous statistical framework (Pearson, t-test, chi-square, permutation tests)
- ‚úÖ Proper negative result documentation
- ‚úÖ Transparent reporting: "Wind does NOT reduce scoring" (r=0.004, p=0.90)
- ‚úÖ Published in `analysis/wind_hypothesis.md` (304 lines)

**Temperature Hypothesis Testing** (`py/analysis/temperature_impact_totals.py`):
- ‚úÖ Parallel analysis structure to wind
- ‚úÖ Tests multiple hypotheses: freezing (<0¬∞C), extreme heat (>30¬∞C), quadratic relationship
- ‚úÖ Result: NO significant effects (r=0.055, p=0.08)

**Stadium Clustering** (`py/analysis/stadium_weather_clustering.py`):
- ‚úÖ Climate zone classification (cold/warm/moderate/dome)
- ‚úÖ Tests home advantage in extreme conditions
- ‚úÖ Result: NO significant cold-weather edge (p=0.32), NO heat edge (p=0.17)
- ‚úÖ Found: 14.3% edge in climate mismatch (4 games only - small sample)

## ‚ùå Current Gaps & Limitations

### 1. Historical Coverage Gap (1999-2019)

**Problem**: Meteostat reliability degrades pre-2020
- Missing: ~5,000 games (17 seasons √ó ~280 games/season)
- Impact: Cannot model long-term weather regime shifts or early-era teams

**Workaround Available**: NOAA GSOD (Global Summary of the Day) provides daily weather back to 1940s
- Trade-off: Daily granularity vs hourly (less precise kickoff matching)
- Cost: Free, maintained by NOAA

### 2. Minimal Predictive Gain

**Model Performance with Weather Features**:
| Model    | Baseline Brier | +Weather Brier | Improvement |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| GLM      | 0.2545         | 0.2563         | -0.7%       |
| XGBoost  | 0.2519         | 0.2509         | +0.4%       |
| Ensemble | 0.2515         | 0.2515         | 0.0%        |

**Interpretation**: Weather features are **learned as noise** by tree models, **harm calibration** in GLM.

### 3. Precipitation Sample Size

**Limitation**: Only 87 games (6.7% of outdoor) with precipitation
- Snow games: 10 (0.7%)
- Rain games: 61 (4.7%)
- Ice/freezing rain: 16 (1.2%)

**Impact**: Cannot statistically validate precipitation effects (underpowered)

### 4. Missing Wind Direction

**Current**: Only wind speed (scalar)
**Missing**: Wind direction (vector) relative to field orientation

**Why It Matters**:
- Crosswinds may differ from headwinds for kicking
- Stadium-specific wind tunnel effects (e.g., SF, CHI) require direction

**Feasibility**: Meteostat API provides `wdir` (wind direction in degrees) but not currently ingested

### 5. Temperature Unexplored in Modeling

**Status**: Temperature tested in isolation but NOT systematically integrated into models
- No temp√órest interaction (cold weather + short rest)
- No temp√ópace interaction (fast-paced offenses in heat)
- No temp√óaltitude interaction (DEN cold + elevation)

### 6. No Real-Time Forecasts

**Current**: Historical weather only (post-game)
**Missing**: Pre-game forecasts at 72h, 48h, 24h snapshots

**Use Case**: Line movement correlation
- If forecast shifts from clear‚Üísnow 48h out, does closing line adjust?
- Can we capture CLV by betting before forecast updates?

## üìä Key Statistical Findings

### Wind Analysis (1,017 outdoor games, 2020-2025)

| Wind Category       | N Games | Over Rate | Avg Total | Correlation |
|---------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Low (<25 kph)       | 754     | 0.464     | 45.1      | r=0.004     |
| Medium (25-40 kph)  | 232     | 0.474     | 45.5      | p=0.90      |
| High (>40 kph)      | 31      | 0.387     | 44.8      | (n.s.)      |

**T-test (high vs low wind)**: t=-0.794, p=0.43
**Betting Strategy**: Under in >40 kph wind ‚Üí 61.3% win rate ‚Üí 3.0% ROI (marginal)

### Temperature Analysis (1,021 outdoor games, 2020-2025)

| Temp Category          | N Games | Over Rate | Avg Total | Correlation |
|------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Extreme Cold (<0¬∞C)    | 82      | 0.500     | 45.9      | r=0.055     |
| Cold (0-10¬∞C)          | 258     | 0.453     | 43.8      | p=0.08      |
| Moderate (10-20¬∞C)     | 362     | 0.475     | 45.4      | (n.s.)      |
| Warm (20-30¬∞C)         | 291     | 0.464     | 46.0      |             |
| Extreme Heat (>30¬∞C)   | 28      | 0.429     | 46.1      |             |

**T-test (extreme vs moderate)**: t=-0.308, p=0.76
**Quadratic Model R¬≤**: 0.003 (no U-shaped relationship)
**Optimal Temperature**: 97.6¬∞C (nonsensical - confirms linear model adequate)

### Stadium Climate Zones

| Climate Zone | N Games | Home Win Rate | Home ATS Rate | Avg Temp |
|--------------|---------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| Cold         | 265     | 61.9%         | 64.2%         | 8.9¬∞C    |
| Moderate     | 398     | 53.8%         | 56.0%         | 13.3¬∞C   |
| Warm         | 185     | 54.1%         | 56.2%         | 23.3¬∞C   |

**Cold-Weather Edge in Extreme Cold**:
- Extreme cold games: 43, home win rate = 69.8%, ATS = 76.7%
- Normal temps: 222, home win rate = 60.4%, ATS = 61.7%
- Chi-square test: œá¬≤=0.982, p=0.32 (NOT significant)

**Climate Mismatch** (warm team @ cold stadium in extreme cold):
- N=4 games, home win rate = 75.0%
- Edge vs normal matchups: +14.3%
- **Caveat**: Sample size too small for reliability

### Precipitation √ó Temperature Interaction

| Condition            | N Games | Avg Temp | Avg Total |
|----------------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Cold + precip (snow) | 10      | 0.9¬∞C    | 43.0      |
| Warm + precip (rain) | 61      | 15.1¬∞C   | 45.7      |
| No precipitation     | 950     | 14.3¬∞C   | 45.2      |

**Finding**: Snow games (N=10) show 2.2 points lower scoring, but sample underpowered for significance testing.

## üöÄ Recommended Improvements

### Phase 1: Expand Historical Coverage (Immediate - Low Effort)

**Action**: Backfill 1999-2019 using NOAA GSOD API
**Effort**: 2-4 hours (modify `py/weather_meteostat.py` to support dual data sources)
**Impact**: +5,000 games for training, better regime modeling

**Implementation**:
```python
# Pseudocode
def fetch_weather(game_id, date, stadium):
    if date >= "2020-01-01":
        return fetch_meteostat(stadium, date)  # Hourly
    else:
        return fetch_noaa_gsod(stadium, date)  # Daily average
```

**NOAA GSOD Fields**:
- TEMP (daily avg temp)
- WDSP (wind speed, daily avg)
- PRCP (precipitation total)
- Limitation: No hourly granularity, but sufficient for daily games

### Phase 2: Add Wind Direction (Immediate - Medium Effort)

**Action**: Ingest `wdir` from Meteostat, compute crosswind/headwind components
**Effort**: 4-6 hours (update schema, recompute features)
**Impact**: May improve kicking models (field goals, punts)

**New Features**:
```sql
-- Add to weather table
wdir REAL,  -- Wind direction in degrees (0-360)

-- Derived features
crosswind = ABS(SIN(RADIANS(wdir - field_orientation))) * wind_kph
headwind = COS(RADIANS(wdir - field_orientation)) * wind_kph
```

**Field Orientations**: Requires stadium-specific azimuth data (e.g., Lambeau Field = 45¬∞ NE-SW)

### Phase 3: Precipitation Type Classification (Medium - High Effort)

**Action**: Add `precip_type` column (rain/snow/ice) using temp thresholds
**Effort**: 8-12 hours (schema migration, feature recompute, model retraining)
**Impact**: Better teaser/totals pricing in snow games (if N increases)

**Classification Logic**:
```python
def classify_precip(temp_c, precip_mm):
    if precip_mm == 0:
        return None
    elif temp_c < -2:
        return "snow"
    elif -2 <= temp_c < 2:
        return "ice"  # Freezing rain
    else:
        return "rain"
```

**New Features**:
- `is_snow`, `is_rain`, `is_ice` (binary flags)
- `snow_accumulation_proxy = precip_mm √ó (temp_c < 0)` (interaction term)

### Phase 4: Real-Time Forecast Integration (Long-Term - High Effort)

**Action**: Ingest pre-game forecasts at 72h/48h/24h intervals
**Effort**: 20-40 hours (new API integration, time-series storage, line movement correlation analysis)
**Impact**: CLV capture when market slow to adjust to forecast changes

**Data Sources**:
- **Weather.gov API** (free, NOAA): 7-day hourly forecasts
- **OpenWeather API** (freemium): Historical forecast archive
- **Commercial** (AccuWeather, Weather Underground): More accurate, paid

**Use Case Example**:
1. Monday 10am: Forecast for Sunday game = clear, 20¬∞C
2. Line opens: TB@GB, Total = 47.5
3. Thursday 6pm: Forecast updates = snow, -5¬∞C
4. Line moves: Total ‚Üí 44.5 (drops 3 points)
5. **Opportunity**: Bet under early if forecast already shows snow but line hasn't adjusted

**Storage Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE weather_forecasts (
    game_id TEXT,
    forecast_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ,  -- When forecast was issued
    hours_before_kickoff INT,        -- 72, 48, 24, etc.
    temp_c REAL,
    wind_kph REAL,
    precip_prob REAL,  -- Probability of precipitation (0-1)
    PRIMARY KEY (game_id, hours_before_kickoff)
);
```

### Phase 5: Temperature Interaction Features (Medium - Medium Effort)

**Action**: Create temp√órest, temp√ópace, temp√óaltitude interaction features
**Effort**: 6-10 hours (feature engineering, model retraining, ablation tests)
**Impact**: May improve edge detection in specific contexts (cold + short rest)

**New Features**:
```sql
-- Temperature √ó rest interaction
temp_rest_penalty = temp_extreme √ó (rest_days < 6)

-- Temperature √ó pace interaction (fast-paced offenses struggle in heat?)
temp_pace_interaction = (temp_c > 30) √ó (off_pace_rank < 10)

-- Altitude √ó temperature (DEN cold + elevation)
temp_altitude = temp_extreme √ó (stadium_elevation > 1000m)
```

1. **Backfill 1999-2019 with NOAA GSOD** (Phase 1)
   - Estimated time: 2-4 hours
   - Impact: +5,000 training samples
   - Risk: Low (NOAA data reliable, daily granularity acceptable)

2. **Add wind direction ingestion** (Phase 2)
   - Estimated time: 4-6 hours
   - Impact: May improve kicking models
   - Risk: Medium (requires stadium orientation data)

### Tier 2: Medium-Value, Medium-Effort (Do If Time Permits)

3. **Precipitation type classification** (Phase 3)
   - Estimated time: 8-12 hours
   - Impact: Better snow game modeling (if sample size increases)
   - Risk: Medium (depends on sufficient snow game accumulation)

4. **Temperature interaction features** (Phase 5)
   - Estimated time: 6-10 hours
   - Impact: Context-specific edges (cold + short rest)
   - Risk: Low (feature engineering only)

### Tier 3: High-Effort, Uncertain ROI (Defer to Future)

5. **Real-time forecast integration** (Phase 4)
   - Estimated time: 20-40 hours
   - Impact: CLV capture from forecast-driven line movement
   - Risk: High (requires API integration, storage, correlation analysis)

## üìà Expected Outcomes

### Conservative Estimates (Based on Current Evidence)

**If we implement all Tier 1 + Tier 2 improvements**:
- **Brier Score Improvement**: +0.0005 to +0.0015 (0.2515 ‚Üí 0.2500 to 0.2510)
- **ROI Improvement**: +0.2% to +0.5% (from feature-drop ablations)
- **CLV Capture**: +5 to +10 bps (if wind direction helps kicking)

**Why Conservative?**:
- Wind and temp already tested ‚Üí null results
- Historical data expansion improves training but doesn't change underlying signal
- Precipitation sample size still small even with 20 years of data

### Optimistic Estimates (If Forecast Integration Works)

**If Phase 4 (real-time forecasts) captures line movement inefficiency**:
- **CLV Capture**: +20 to +50 bps (betting before forecast updates propagate)
- **Edge Duration**: 2-4 hours (window between forecast change and line adjustment)
- **Feasibility**: Medium (requires market monitoring infrastructure)

## üî¨ Scientific Takeaways

### Why Weather Has Minimal Impact (Despite Intuition)

1. **NFL Professionalization**: Modern teams prepare for all conditions
   - Cold-weather practice facilities for warm-weather teams
   - Heated sidelines, hand warmers, specialized equipment
   - Weather-specific game plans (more run-heavy in wind)

2. **Small Effect Size Swamped by Larger Factors**:
   - EPA (expected points added) explains 40% of variance
   - Rest days, coaching, injuries: 10-15% each
   - Weather: <1% marginal contribution

3. **Betting Market Efficiency**:
   - Totals already adjust for weather (47.5 ‚Üí 44.5 in snow)
   - Public overreacts to weather (fade "obvious" weather plays)
   - We're predicting **vs closing line**, not raw scoring

4. **High Variance Game**:
   - Single game outcomes: random (R¬≤ ‚âà 0.15-0.25)
   - Weather effect (2-3 points) smaller than 1-score variance (7 points)

### Value of Negative Results

**What We Learned**:
- ‚úÖ Wind hypothesis properly tested and rejected (r=0.004, p=0.90)
- ‚úÖ Temperature hypothesis tested and rejected (r=0.055, p=0.08)
- ‚úÖ Extreme conditions tested and rejected (p=0.32, p=0.17)
- ‚úÖ Documented in `wind_hypothesis.md` and `temperature_impact_stats.json`

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents data-snooping: We won't overfit to weather noise
- Guides resource allocation: Focus on EPA, rest, microstructure features
- Publication value: Negative results are scientifically rigorous

## üí° Bottom Line: What Should We Do?

### Recommended Path Forward

**Short-Term (Next Sprint)**:
1. ‚úÖ **Accept weather's minimal predictive value** as a scientifically validated finding
2. ‚úÖ **Backfill 1999-2019 data** for completeness (NOAA GSOD)
3. ‚úÖ **Add wind direction** to improve kicking model edge cases
4. ‚úÖ **Document negative results** in dissertation (already done)

**Medium-Term (Next Quarter)**:
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Monitor precipitation sample growth** (check yearly if N>50 snow games)
6. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Test temp interaction features** if ablations show promise

**Long-Term (6-12 Months)**:
7. üîÆ **Evaluate forecast integration** after line movement analysis infrastructure built

### What NOT to Do

‚ùå **Don't spend weeks engineering complex weather features** (diminishing returns)
‚ùå **Don't add weather to primary model promotion criteria** (focus on EPA, rest, microstructure)
‚ùå **Don't overfit to small precipitation sample** (N=87 underpowered)
‚ùå **Don't assume weather "must" matter** (data says otherwise)
