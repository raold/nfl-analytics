## Detailed Findings

### 1. ⚠️ CRITICAL: Weather Data Duplication

**Problem**: Weather data exists in TWO places with different schemas:

| Source | Columns | Coverage | Data Type | Issue |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|-------|
| `games.temp` | temp, wind | 5,016 games (71.7%) | **TEXT** | String format, inconsistent |
| `weather.temp_c` | temp_c, wind_kph | 1,315 games (18.8%) | **REAL** | Numeric, structured |
| **Overlap** | Both sources | 756 games (10.8%) | **CONFLICT** | Two sources of truth |

**Example Conflict**:
```sql
-- Game with both sources
SELECT g.game_id, g.temp, g.wind, w.temp_c, w.wind_kph
FROM games g
INNER JOIN weather w ON g.game_id = w.game_id
WHERE g.temp IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1;

-- Result might show:
-- game_id: 2023_01_BAL_CIN
-- g.temp: "55"           <-- String
-- g.wind: "10"           <-- String  
-- w.temp_c: 12.8         <-- Numeric (Celsius)
-- w.wind_kph: 16.1       <-- Numeric (km/h)
```

**Impact**:
- Feature engineering scripts may use wrong source
- Inconsistent temperature units (games uses °F?, weather uses °C)
- Wasted storage (duplicate data)
- Maintenance burden (two places to update)

**Recommendation**: 
```sql
-- OPTION 1: Drop games.temp/wind columns (use weather table only)
ALTER TABLE games DROP COLUMN temp, DROP COLUMN wind;

-- OPTION 2: Consolidate into games table (drop weather table)
-- Copy weather.temp_c/wind_kph into games, convert to consistent units
UPDATE games g
SET 
  temp = w.temp_c::text,
  wind = w.wind_kph::text
FROM weather w
WHERE g.game_id = w.game_id AND g.temp IS NULL;

DROP TABLE weather;

-- OPTION 3 (RECOMMENDED): Keep weather table, mark games.temp/wind as deprecated
-- Add comments to schema
COMMENT ON COLUMN games.temp IS 'DEPRECATED: Use weather.temp_c instead (Celsius)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN games.wind IS 'DEPRECATED: Use weather.wind_kph instead (km/h)';
```

---

### 2. ⚠️ MODERATE: Missing Turnovers Data

**Problem**: 880 games (12.6%) have NULL values for `home_turnovers` or `away_turnovers`

**Coverage by Season**:
```sql
SELECT 
  season,
  COUNT(*) as total_games,
  COUNT(home_turnovers) as has_turnovers,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(home_turnovers) / COUNT(*), 1) as pct_coverage
FROM games
GROUP BY season
ORDER BY season;
```

**Analysis**:
- Missing data likely from pre-2000 seasons (plays table incomplete)
- Calculated from `plays.fumble_lost` + `plays.interception`
- If plays data missing → turnovers NULL

**Impact**:
- Feature `prior_turnovers_avg_diff` has NULL values
- Models must handle missing data (imputation or exclude)
- Reduces training data for turnover-based features

**Recommendation**:
```sql
-- Verify which seasons are missing
SELECT season, week, game_id
FROM games
WHERE home_turnovers IS NULL
ORDER BY season, week
LIMIT 20;

-- If pre-2000 data: Document as expected limitation
-- If 2000+ data: Re-run backfill script for those games

-- Add data quality check to backfill script:
-- Should log warning for games with NULL turnovers if plays exist
```

---

### 3. ⚠️ MODERATE: Missing Penalties Data

**Problem**: 934 games (13.4%) have NULL values for `home_penalties` or `away_penalties`

**Similar Issue to Turnovers**:
- Calculated from `plays.penalty` column
- Missing when plays data incomplete

**Recommendation**:
```sql
-- Same as turnovers: verify season distribution
SELECT season, COUNT(*) as missing_penalties
FROM games
WHERE home_penalties IS NULL
GROUP BY season
ORDER BY season;

-- Document expected limitations for older seasons
-- Re-run backfill for recent seasons if missing
```

---

### 4. ℹ️ MINOR: Missing Player Positions

**Problem**: 12 players (0.08%) have NULL `position` values

**Analysis**:
```sql
SELECT player_id, player_name, position
FROM players
WHERE position IS NULL;
```

**Impact**: Minimal (only 0.08% of players)

**Recommendation**:
```sql
-- Manual fix: Look up positions for these 12 players
-- Add to backfill script:
UPDATE players
SET position = 'UNKNOWN'
WHERE position IS NULL;
```

---

### 5. ℹ️ MINOR: Missing EPA/WP in Plays

**Problem**: 
- 14,138 plays (1.1%) missing `epa` and `success`
- 7,152 plays (0.6%) missing `wp`
- 48,116 pass plays (4.3% of passes) missing `passer_player_id`

**Analysis**:
- Expected: Some play types don't have EPA (penalties, timeouts, etc.)
- Expected: Pre-snap plays don't have win probability
- Expected: Some passes don't have identified passer (broken plays)

**Impact**: Minimal - these are edge cases

**Recommendation**: Document as expected, no action needed

---

## Schema Validation

### Table Relationships
```
games (PK: game_id) ──┬── plays (FK: game_id)
                      ├── weather (FK: game_id)
                      ├── injuries (FK: game_id)
                      └── mart.team_epa (FK: game_id)

players (PK: player_id) ── rosters (FK: player_id)
```

✅ **All foreign keys valid** (no orphan records)

### Primary Key Integrity
| Table | PK Columns | Duplicate Keys | Status |
|-------|------------|----------------|--------|
| games | game_id | 0 | ✅ VALID |
| plays | game_id, play_id | 0 | ✅ VALID |
| weather | game_id | 0 | ✅ VALID |
| players | player_id | 0 | ✅ VALID |
| rosters | season, week, team, player_id | 0 | ✅ VALID |
| mart.team_epa | game_id, posteam | 0 | ✅ VALID |
| mart.game_summary | game_id | 0 | ✅ VALID |

✅ **All primary keys unique**

### Data Type Consistency

**✅ CONSISTENT**:
- All `game_id` columns are `TEXT`
- All `season` columns are `INTEGER`
- All `player_id` columns are `TEXT`

**⚠️ INCONSISTENT**:
- `games.temp` is `TEXT`, should be `REAL` (or drop column)
- `games.wind` is `TEXT`, should be `REAL` (or drop column)

## Recommended Cleanup Actions

### Priority 1: MUST FIX (Production Blockers)

#### Action 1.1: Resolve Weather Data Duplication
```sql
-- Step 1: Audit the conflict
CREATE TEMP TABLE weather_audit AS
SELECT 
  g.game_id,
  g.season,
  g.temp as games_temp_text,
  g.wind as games_wind_text,
  w.temp_c as weather_temp_c,
  w.wind_kph as weather_wind_kph,
  CASE 
    WHEN g.temp IS NOT NULL AND w.temp_c IS NOT NULL THEN 'both'
    WHEN g.temp IS NOT NULL THEN 'games_only'
    WHEN w.temp_c IS NOT NULL THEN 'weather_only'
    ELSE 'neither'
  END as data_source
FROM games g
LEFT JOIN weather w ON g.game_id = w.game_id;

SELECT data_source, COUNT(*) FROM weather_audit GROUP BY data_source;

-- Step 2: Choose canonical source
-- RECOMMENDED: Keep weather.temp_c/wind_kph (numeric, structured)
--              Drop games.temp/wind (string, inconsistent)

-- Step 3: Backup before dropping
CREATE TABLE games_backup_weather AS
SELECT game_id, temp, wind FROM games WHERE temp IS NOT NULL;

-- Step 4: Drop deprecated columns
ALTER TABLE games DROP COLUMN temp;
ALTER TABLE games DROP COLUMN wind;

-- Step 5: Update feature engineering to use weather table
-- Edit: py/features/asof_features_enhanced.py
-- Change: games.temp → weather.temp_c (with LEFT JOIN)
```

**Rollback Plan**:
```sql
-- If needed, restore from backup
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN temp TEXT;
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN wind TEXT;
UPDATE games g
SET temp = b.temp, wind = b.wind
FROM games_backup_weather b
WHERE g.game_id = b.game_id;
```

#### Action 1.2: Document Missing Data
```sql
-- Create data quality metadata table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.data_quality_log (
  table_name TEXT,
  column_name TEXT,
  issue_type TEXT,
  affected_rows INTEGER,
  expected BOOLEAN,
  notes TEXT,
  checked_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Log known issues
INSERT INTO data_quality_log (table_name, column_name, issue_type, affected_rows, expected, notes) VALUES
('games', 'home_turnovers', 'NULL values', 880, TRUE, 'Expected: pre-2000 seasons lack play-by-play data'),
('games', 'away_turnovers', 'NULL values', 880, TRUE, 'Expected: pre-2000 seasons lack play-by-play data'),
('games', 'home_penalties', 'NULL values', 934, TRUE, 'Expected: pre-2000 seasons lack play-by-play data'),
('games', 'away_penalties', 'NULL values', 934, TRUE, 'Expected: pre-2000 seasons lack play-by-play data'),
('rosters', 'season', 'missing seasons', 3, TRUE, 'Expected: nflreadr has no data for 1999-2001'),
('players', 'position', 'NULL values', 12, FALSE, 'Action needed: manual lookup for 12 players');
```

### Priority 2: SHOULD FIX (Quality Improvements)

#### Action 2.1: Fix Missing Player Positions
```sql
-- Find the 12 players with NULL positions
SELECT player_id, player_name, rookie_year, draft_club
FROM players
WHERE position IS NULL;

-- Manual lookup and update
-- (Requires looking up each player on pro-football-reference.com)
UPDATE players SET position = 'QB' WHERE player_id = 'xxx'; -- example
-- ... repeat for all 12 players

-- Or set default
UPDATE players SET position = 'UNKNOWN' WHERE position IS NULL;
```

#### Action 2.2: Add Schema Comments
```sql
-- Document tables
COMMENT ON TABLE games IS 'NFL games 1999-2024 with betting lines, scores, and metadata';
COMMENT ON TABLE plays IS 'Play-by-play data with EPA, WP, and player-level tracking';
COMMENT ON TABLE weather IS 'Weather data from Meteostat (2020-2024 games)';
COMMENT ON TABLE players IS 'Unique NFL players with position, draft info (from nflreadr)';
COMMENT ON TABLE rosters IS 'Weekly rosters 2002-2024 (no data for 1999-2001)';

-- Document critical columns
COMMENT ON COLUMN games.home_turnovers IS 'Turnovers by home team (NULL for pre-2000 games)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN games.away_turnovers IS 'Turnovers by away team (NULL for pre-2000 games)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN games.home_penalties IS 'Penalties by home team (NULL for pre-2000 games)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN games.away_penalties IS 'Penalties by away team (NULL for pre-2000 games)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN weather.temp_c IS 'Temperature in Celsius from Meteostat';
COMMENT ON COLUMN weather.wind_kph IS 'Wind speed in km/h from Meteostat';
```

#### Action 2.3: Create Data Validation Tests
```python
# tests/test_data_quality.py
import pytest
import psycopg

@pytest.fixture
def conn():
    return psycopg.connect(
        "postgresql://dro:sicillionbillions@localhost:5544/devdb01"
    )

def test_no_duplicate_game_ids(conn):
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("SELECT game_id FROM games GROUP BY game_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1")
        assert cur.fetchone() is None, "Duplicate game_ids found"

def test_no_orphan_rosters(conn):
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("""
            SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rosters r
            LEFT JOIN players p ON r.player_id = p.player_id
            WHERE p.player_id IS NULL
        """)
        count = cur.fetchone()[0]
        assert count == 0, f"{count} orphan roster records found"

def test_expected_missing_data(conn):
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("""
            SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games 
            WHERE season >= 2000 
              AND (home_turnovers IS NULL OR away_turnovers IS NULL)
        """)
        count = cur.fetchone()[0]
        assert count < 100, f"Too many NULL turnovers in post-2000 games: {count}"

# Run with: pytest tests/test_data_quality.py
```

### Priority 3: NICE TO HAVE (Future Enhancements)

#### Action 3.1: Implement Automated Backfill Checks
```bash
# scripts/validate_backfill.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "=== Validating Database After Backfill ==="

# Check for expected row counts
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT 
    CASE 
      WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games) < 6900 THEN '❌ games count too low'
      WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM plays) < 1200000 THEN '❌ plays count too low'
      WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players) < 15000 THEN '❌ players count too low'
      ELSE '✅ Row counts OK'
    END as status;
"

# Check for duplicate keys
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT '❌ DUPLICATE game_ids' WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT game_id FROM games GROUP BY game_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
  )
  UNION ALL
  SELECT '✅ No duplicate game_ids' WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT game_id FROM games GROUP BY game_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
  );
"

# Add more checks...
```

#### Action 3.2: Setup Backup Strategy
```bash
# Automated daily backup
0 2 * * * pg_dump -h localhost -p 5544 -U dro -d devdb01 -F c -f /backups/devdb01_$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).backup

# Keep last 7 days
0 3 * * * find /backups -name "devdb01_*.backup" -mtime +7 -delete
```
