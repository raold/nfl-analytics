**Total Value**: $900-1,900/year

**Break-Even**:

## Key Metrics to Track

### Data Source ROI
```python
# Track incremental value per data source
data_roi = {
    'nfl_plus': {
        'cost': 40,
        'bets_influenced': 0,  # Count bets avoided due to injury
        'value_added': 0,      # $ saved from avoiding bad bets
        'roi': 0,              # value_added / cost
    },
    'odds_api': {
        'cost': 300,
        'cents_gained': [],    # List of cents gained per bet
        'avg_improvement': 0,  # Mean cents per bet
        'total_value': 0,      # Sum of EV gains
        'roi': 0,
    },
}
```

### Model Accuracy Impact
```python
# A/B test: model with vs without new data source
baseline_brier = 0.1715  # v2 model
with_new_data_brier = 0.1700  # hypothetical improvement

improvement = baseline_brier - with_new_data_brier
# 0.0015 improvement → ~0.9% better

# Value: 0.9% better on 100 bets/year = 0.9 extra wins
# At $100/bet → $90 extra profit
# If data costs $500 → ROI = 18% (NOT WORTH IT)
```
