## Phase 1: State-Space Models ✅

**File:** `R/state_space_player_skills.R` (388 lines)

### Innovation

Time-varying player skills instead of static ratings:
- Hot/cold streaks
- Injury recovery trajectories
- Aging curves
- Momentum effects

### Implementation

```r
# LOESS smoothing as Kalman filter approximation
compute_dynamic_skill <- function(player_data) {
  loess_fit <- loess(
    log_yards ~ game_num,
    data = player_data,
    span = 0.3,  # Responsive to recent 30% of games
    degree = 1
  )
  player_data$dynamic_skill <- predict(loess_fit)
  return(player_data)
}

# Hierarchical model with time-varying covariate
formula <- bf(
  log_yards ~ 1 +
    dynamic_skill +           # Time-varying player skill
    log_attempts +
    is_home +
    (1 | player_id) +         # Baseline skill (pooled)
    (1 | team),
  sigma ~ log_attempts        # Distributional regression
)
```

### Key Features

1. **LOESS Smoothing**: Local polynomial regression captures non-linear trends
2. **Game-indexed time**: Chronological ordering per player
3. **Hierarchical integration**: Dynamic skill as covariate in brms model
4. **Skill trajectories**: Track improvement/decline over time

### Output

- Model: `models/bayesian/state_space_passing_v1.rds`
- Trajectories: `models/bayesian/player_skill_trajectories_v1.csv`
- Database: `mart.bayesian_player_ratings` (model_version='state_space_v1.0')

### Use Cases

1. **Identify hot streaks**: Players performing above baseline
2. **Injury recovery**: Track return-to-form trajectories
3. **Aging curves**: Model performance decline/improvement
4. **Bet sizing**: Higher confidence on stable players

### Expected Impact

**+0.3-0.5% additional ROI** from:
- Better capture of form/momentum
- Reduced false positives from players on cold streaks
- Improved Kelly sizing (low volatility = bet more)

## Phase 2: Advanced Priors ✅

**File:** `R/advanced_priors_elicitation.R` (320 lines)

### Innovation

Move from weakly-informative to **data-driven + expert-informed priors**:

1. **Empirical Bayes**: Estimate priors from historical data (2015-2019)
2. **Expert knowledge**: QB tiers, weather effects, positional differences
3. **Prior predictive checks**: Validate priors against data
4. **Hierarchical shrinkage**: Multi-level variance estimation

### Empirical Prior Estimation

```r
# Estimate from historical data
player_sd <- sd(player_means$mean_log_yards)  # ~0.15
within_player_sd <- mean(sd_per_player)       # ~0.35

# Informative priors
informative_priors <- c(
  # Intercept: Historical mean log yards
  prior(normal(5.5, 0.3), class = Intercept),

  # Player-level SD: Empirical estimate
  prior(normal(0.15, 0.05), class = sd, group = player_id),

  # Home field advantage: Historical regression
  prior(normal(0.03, 0.02), class = b, coef = is_home),

  # Bad weather: Expert + historical
  prior(normal(-0.08, 0.04), class = b, coef = is_bad_weather)
)
```

### Expert Knowledge Integration

**QB Tiers:**
- Elite (Mahomes, Allen): +15% prior adjustment
- Good (Stafford): +5%
- Average: 0%
- Below average: -10%

**Weather Effects:**
- Indoor/dome: 0% (baseline)
- Outdoor good: -2%
- Outdoor cold (<40°F): -8% (historical)
- Outdoor wind: -12% (expert)
- Outdoor snow: -15% (expert)

### Output

- Model: `models/bayesian/passing_informative_priors_v1.rds`
- Prior specs: `models/bayesian/prior_specifications_v1.csv`
- QB tiers: `models/bayesian/qb_tier_priors.csv`

### Benefits

1. **Better shrinkage**: Low-sample players shrink toward informed priors
2. **Faster convergence**: Informative priors → fewer MCMC iterations
3. **More stable**: Reduces overfitting to recent noise
4. **Domain expertise**: Incorporates real football knowledge

### Expected Impact

**+0.2-0.5% additional ROI** from:
- Improved predictions for low-sample players
- Better calibration of uncertainty
- Reduced variance in predictions

---

## Phase 3: Bayesian Neural Networks ✅

**File:** `py/models/bayesian_neural_network.py` (370 lines)

### Innovation

**Full uncertainty quantification for neural networks** using PyMC:

- Weight posteriors (not point estimates)
- Automatic uncertainty propagation
- Better calibration than frequentist NNs
- Captures complex non-linear interactions

### Architecture

```python
Input (n_features)
    ↓
Dense(64) + ReLU    [w1 ~ N(0, w1_sd), w1_sd ~ HalfNormal(1)]
    ↓
Dense(32) + ReLU    [w2 ~ N(0, w2_sd), w2_sd ~ HalfNormal(1)]
    ↓
Output(1)           [w_out ~ N(0, w_out_sd)]
    ↓
y ~ N(y_pred, σ)    [σ ~ HalfNormal(1)]
```

### Inference Methods

1. **ADVI** (Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference):
   - Fast (~2-5 minutes)
   - Approximate posterior
   - Good for production

2. **NUTS** (No-U-Turn Sampler):
   - Slower (~15-30 minutes)
   - Exact posterior (gold standard)
   - Best for research/validation

### Usage

```python
from py.models.bayesian_neural_network import BayesianNeuralNetwork

# Train
bnn = BayesianNeuralNetwork(
    hidden_dims=(64, 32),
    inference_method="advi",
    n_samples=2000
)

bnn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict with uncertainty
pred_mean, pred_std = bnn.predict(X_test, return_std=True)

# Save/load
bnn.save("models/bayesian/bnn_passing_v1.pkl")
bnn_loaded = BayesianNeuralNetwork.load("models/bayesian/bnn_passing_v1.pkl")
```

### Key Features

1. **Hierarchical priors**: Learn weight variance from data
2. **ReLU activations**: Non-linear transformations
3. **Uncertainty quantification**: Full posterior distribution
4. **Feature scaling**: Automatic StandardScaler
5. **Model persistence**: Joblib serialization

### Expected Impact

**+0.3-0.8% additional ROI** from:
- Better modeling of non-linear interactions
- Improved uncertainty estimates
- Captures patterns XGBoost might miss
- Complementary to tree-based models

## Phase 4: Integration - 4-Way Ensemble ✅

**File:** `py/ensemble/enhanced_ensemble_v3.py` (280 lines)

### Architecture

```
Base Models (3):
1. Bayesian Hierarchical (R/brms)
   - QB-WR chemistry
   - Distributional regression
   - Informative priors
   - State-space dynamics

2. XGBoost
   - Gradient boosting baseline
   - Tree-based interactions

3. Bayesian Neural Network (PyMC)
   - Non-linear modeling
   - Full uncertainty

Meta-Learner (1):
4. Stacked Ensemble
   - Learns optimal weighting
   - Dynamic model selection
   - Inverse variance weighting

Portfolio Optimization:
5. Correlation-adjusted Kelly
   - Quadratic programming
   - Risk management
```

### Ensemble Strategy

**Inverse Variance Weighting** (if meta-learner not trained):

```python
bayesian_var = bayesian_uncertainty**2
bnn_var = bnn_uncertainty**2
xgb_var = 0.1  # Fixed variance

total_precision = 1/bayesian_var + 1/xgb_var + 1/bnn_var

ensemble_pred = (
    bayesian_pred / bayesian_var +
    xgb_pred / xgb_var +
    bnn_pred / bnn_var
) / total_precision
```

**Stacked Meta-Learner** (preferred):

```python
meta_features = {
    'bayesian_pred', 'xgb_pred', 'bnn_pred',
    'bayesian_uncertainty', 'bnn_uncertainty',
    'bayesian_xgb_diff', 'bayesian_bnn_diff',
    'mean_pred', 'std_pred',
    'bayesian_weight', 'bnn_weight'
}

ensemble_pred = meta_learner.predict(meta_features)
```

### Expected Impact

**Total ensemble ROI: +5.0-7.0%**

Component breakdown:
- Bayesian hierarchical: +3.5% (with all enhancements)
- XGBoost: +4.0% (baseline)
- BNN: +2.5% (new)
- Ensemble effect: +0.5-1.0% (from optimal weighting)
