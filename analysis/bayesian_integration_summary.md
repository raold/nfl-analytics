## Implementation Components

### 1. Bayesian Feature Integration (`py/features/bayesian_features.py`)

**Purpose**: Export Bayesian team ratings from database and merge into XGBoost feature pipeline

**Key Features Added**:

| Feature Name | Description | Range |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| `home_bayesian_rating` | Home team posterior mean rating | -4.1 to +4.9 |
| `away_bayesian_rating` | Away team posterior mean rating | -4.1 to +4.9 |
| `home_bayesian_sd` | Home team rating uncertainty | ~0.96-1.03 |
| `away_bayesian_sd` | Away team rating uncertainty | ~0.96-1.03 |
| `bayesian_rating_diff` | Home - away rating difference | -9.0 to +9.0 |
| `bayesian_combined_sd` | Combined uncertainty (sqrt sum) | ~1.36-1.45 |
| `bayesian_confidence` | Inverse uncertainty (1/(1+SD)) | 0.41-0.42 |
| `bayesian_pred_margin` | Predicted margin (rating_diff + 2.4) | -6.6 to +11.4 |
| `bayesian_prob_home` | Probability home team wins | 0.31-0.80 |
| `home_bayesian_q05` | 5th percentile (90% CI lower) | -6.97 to +2.21 |
| `home_bayesian_q95` | 95th percentile (90% CI upper) | -1.39 to +7.61 |
| `away_bayesian_q05` | Away 5th percentile | -6.97 to +2.21 |
| `away_bayesian_q95` | Away 95th percentile | -1.39 to +7.61 |

**Usage**:
```bash
python py/features/bayesian_features.py \
  --input data/processed/features/asof_team_features_v3.csv \
  --output data/processed/features/asof_team_features_v3_bayesian.csv \
  --add-predictions
```

**Output**:
- Input: 143 features → Output: 156 features (+13 Bayesian)
- Successfully merged into 5,211 games (2003-2025 seasons)

---

### 2. Ensemble Voting System (`py/production/ensemble_bayesian_xgb.py`)

**Purpose**: Combine Bayesian and XGBoost predictions using agreement filtering and uncertainty-based position sizing

**Core Algorithm**:

```python
def make_bet_decision(bayesian_prob, xgb_prob, spread, bayesian_sd):
    # 1. Compute weighted ensemble probability
    ensemble_prob = 0.25 * bayesian_prob + 0.75 * xgb_prob

    # 2. Check model agreement
    models_agree = abs(bayesian_prob - xgb_prob) <= 0.10

    # 3. Compute betting edge vs market
    edge = ensemble_prob - implied_prob_from_spread(spread)

    # 4. Decision rule
    if models_agree and edge > 0.02:
        kelly_fraction = compute_kelly(edge, bayesian_sd)
        return BET
    else:
        return SKIP
```

**Configuration Parameters**:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `bayesian_weight` | 0.25 | Weight for Bayesian predictions (15-25% recommended) |
| `xgb_weight` | 0.75 | Weight for XGBoost predictions (75-85% recommended) |
| `agreement_threshold` | 0.10 | Max probability difference to consider agreement |
| `edge_threshold` | 0.02 | Minimum edge (2%) to place bet after vig |
| `vig_rate` | 0.024 | Vigorish rate (-110 odds = 4.76% effective vig) |

**Kelly Criterion Sizing**:
```python
confidence = 1.0 / (1.0 + bayesian_sd)
kelly_fraction = base_kelly * confidence * min(edge / 0.05, 1.0)

# Example:
# Low SD (1.0)   → confidence=0.50 → 1/8 Kelly
# Medium SD (1.4) → confidence=0.42 → 1/10 Kelly
# High SD (1.7)   → confidence=0.37 → 1/12 Kelly
```

**Usage**:
```bash
python py/production/ensemble_bayesian_xgb.py \
  --games data/processed/features/asof_team_features_v3_bayesian.csv \
  --xgb-model models/xgboost/v3_best.json \
  --test-season 2024 \
  --output analysis/ensemble/bayesian_xgb_2024.json
```

## Integration Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Bayesian Features

```bash
# From existing v3 features, add Bayesian ratings
python py/features/bayesian_features.py \
  --input data/processed/features/asof_team_features_v3.csv \
  --output data/processed/features/asof_team_features_v3_bayesian.csv \
  --add-predictions
```

**Output**: `asof_team_features_v3_bayesian.csv` with 156 features (143 original + 13 Bayesian)

### Step 2: Train XGBoost with Bayesian Features

```bash
# Train XGBoost v3 model with Bayesian features included
python py/models/xgboost_gpu_v3.py \
  --features-csv data/processed/features/asof_team_features_v3_bayesian.csv \
  --start-season 2006 \
  --end-season 2021 \
  --test-seasons 2024 \
  --output-dir models/xgboost/v3_bayesian \
  --device cpu
```

**Expected Improvement**: Bayesian features as inputs should improve Brier score by +0.3-0.5%

### Step 3: Run Ensemble Evaluation

```bash
# Evaluate ensemble on historical seasons
python py/production/ensemble_bayesian_xgb.py \
  --games data/processed/features/asof_team_features_v3_bayesian.csv \
  --xgb-model models/xgboost/v3_bayesian/best.json \
  --test-season 2022 \
  --output analysis/ensemble/ensemble_2022.json

# Repeat for 2023, 2024
```

**Expected Results** (based on R analysis):
- **2024 season**: 120 bets, 55.0% win rate, +2.60% ROI
- **2022-2023**: Similar performance if market inefficiencies persist

## Why Bayesian Models Add Value

### Complementary Strengths

| XGBoost | Bayesian |
|---------|----------|
| Non-linear interactions | Temporal smoothing |
| 200+ features | Regularized estimates |
| Gradient boosting | Uncertainty quantification |
| Local predictions | Global team hierarchy |

**Synergy**: XGBoost captures **game-specific factors** (rest, weather, matchups), Bayesian captures **team quality over time** (strength, trends, momentum).

### Unique Value Propositions

1. **Uncertainty for Risk Management**
   - Posterior SDs enable dynamic Kelly sizing
   - High uncertainty → reduce stake
   - Low uncertainty → increase stake (within Kelly limits)

2. **Temporal Dynamics**
   - Time-varying effects capture in-season momentum
   - Random slopes detect teams improving/declining
   - Better than static ELO or Glicko ratings

3. **Hierarchical Regularization**
   - Small-sample teams shrink toward league mean
   - Prevents overfitting to recent noise
   - More stable than raw win percentage

---

## Limitations & Risk Mitigation

### Known Weaknesses

1. **Worse raw accuracy than market** (-8.3%)
   - Market incorporates more information (injuries, weather, betting volume)
   - **Mitigation**: Never bet Bayesian standalone, always ensemble with XGBoost

2. **Limited uncertainty range** (all SD ~1.3-1.5)
   - Need more differentiation between confident/uncertain games
   - **Mitigation**: Add game-specific variance (divisional rivals, playoff games)

3. **Training lag** (ratings based on 2015-2024)
   - May not capture 2025 rule changes or coaching turnover
   - **Mitigation**: Weekly model updates during season

### Risk Management Strategy

- **Never bet Bayesian standalone** - always use ensemble
- **Weekly model retraining** - incorporate latest results
- **Monitor CLV** (Closing Line Value) - reduce weight if performance degrades
- **Stress test** - validate on 2022, 2023 holdout before deploying
- **Position sizing caps** - max 1/4 Kelly even with high confidence

## Expected ROI Projections

### Scenario 1: Bayesian as Features Only (Conservative)

```
Current XGBoost v3: 0.0% ROI, 52.0% win rate
+ Bayesian features: +0.5% Brier improvement
Expected gain: +0.3% ROI
→ Total: +0.3% ROI on all bets
```

**On $10,000 bankroll @ 150 bets/season**: Expected profit = **$30/season**

### Scenario 2: Ensemble Voting with Agreement Filter (Realistic)

```
XGBoost bets: 150/season at 52.0% win rate → +0.0% ROI
+ Bayesian agreement filter: 120/season at 55.0% win rate → +2.6% ROI
Weighted avg: 0.60 * 0.0% + 0.40 * 2.6% = +1.04% ROI
```

**On $10,000 bankroll @ 120 bets/season**: Expected profit = **$104/season**

### Scenario 3: Full Integration (Optimistic)

```
Features + Voting + Uncertainty Kelly = +1.5-2.0% ROI
On $10,000 bankroll @ 100 bets/season:
Expected profit: $150-$200 per season
```

**ROI Sensitivity Analysis**:

| Component | ROI Contribution | Confidence |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| Bayesian features in XGBoost | +0.3% | High (validated in R) |
| Ensemble voting (agreement) | +1.0% | Medium (simulation) |
| Kelly sizing (uncertainty) | +0.2-0.5% | Low (untested) |
| **Total** | **+1.5-1.8%** | **Medium** |

   - Vary `agreement_threshold` (0.05, 0.10, 0.15)
   - Vary `edge_threshold` (0.01, 0.02, 0.03)

2. **A/B test variants**:
   - Variant A: Equal weight (50/50)
   - Variant B: Recommended (25/75)
   - Variant C: Conservative (15/85)

3. **Measure regret** vs optimal strategy in hindsight
