\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{chap:conclusion}

We conclude by reflecting on contributions, limitations, and opportunities to extend the system beyond this dissertation.

\section{Summary of Contributions}
At the outset we claimed: a hybrid stack with explicit uncertainty and governance transforms edge into reliable bankroll growth in NFL markets. The contributions below map directly to that thesis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Integrated classical, ML, and RL models into a coherent NFL betting architecture (edge generation and aggregation).
  \item Quantified uncertainty and embedded risk controls (governance) that turn raw edge into controlled exposure and stable bankroll trajectories.
  \item Demonstrated simulation-driven evaluation with acceptance tests and friction models, linking calibrated predictions to executable value under constraints.
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations}
Key limitations include limited access to proprietary tracking data, potential regime shifts in betting markets, and the challenge of modeling injury uncertainty at scale.

\section{Future Directions}
Future work explores live in-game RL policies, multi-league transfer learning, and automated market-making strategies. Extending governance frameworks to incorporate ethical considerations and responsible gambling guidelines remains essential.

\vspace{0.5em}\noindent\textit{Thesis linkage.} Calibrated models (Ch.~\ref{chap:litreview}, \ref{chap:methods}) supply edge; risk gates (Ch.~\ref{chap:risk}) and dependence-aware simulation (Ch.~\ref{chap:sim}) enforce governance; results (Ch.~\ref{chap:results}) show reliable growth consistent with the thesis.

\section{Closing Reflection}
The research questions in Chapter~\ref{chap:intro} motivated a system-of-systems that begins with calibrated predictions, proceeds through risk-aware policy design, and validates with dependence-aware simulation. This sequence operationalizes the thesis: uncertainty + governance are the mechanisms that convert edge into reliable bankroll growth.

\section{Final Remarks}
The methods developed here emphasize clarity and restraint over opacity and overfitting. We hope the released artefacts and governance templates lower the barrier for researchers seeking to study complex market-facing systems under an academic lens.

\section{Broader Implications}
This work illustrates a path for deploying AI systems in markets with explicit calibration, risk, and governance as firstâ€‘class design goals. The broader implication is that rigorous, auditable decision systems can coexist with operational demands without sacrificing transparency.
