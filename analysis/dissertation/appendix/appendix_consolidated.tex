\chapter{Technical Details}\label{app:technical-details}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Source: Technical Appendix (line 321)
% Includes: Notation, derivations, algorithms, proofs
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Notation}\label{app:notation-summary}
% Source: main.tex line 322-323
We summarize symbols used throughout: $\theta$ for latent team strength, $\lambda,\mu$ for scoring intensities, $D$ for margin, $p$ for spread, $\sigma$ for margin standard deviation, $\hat p$ for model-implied probability, and CBV for comparative book value.

\section{State-Space Derivations}\label{app:state-space}
% Source: main.tex line 325-326
Expanded derivations for the linear-Gaussian filtering and smoothing recursions, and a discussion of approximate inference when observation noise departs from normality.

\section{Score-Distribution Details}\label{app:score-dist}
% Source: main.tex line 328-329
We provide parameterizations for Skellam and bivariate Poisson models, including gradient expressions for efficient maximum-likelihood estimation and notes on reweighting to match key-number frequencies.

\subsection{Score-Distribution Fitting Pipeline}
% Source: main.tex line 1495-1496
We estimate Skellam and bivariate Poisson parameters via maximum likelihood with weakly informative priors and regularization. Optimization uses LBFGS with line search, and gradients exploit closed-form derivatives for Bessel functions where available, falling back to stable numerical routines otherwise. Key-number reweighting is applied post-fit with a constrained least-squares step that preserves moments while matching empirical mass at 3, 6, 7, and 10.

\section{Calibration Diagnostics}\label{app:calibration}
% Source: main.tex line 331-332
This section documents the computation of reliability diagrams, ECE, and CRPS. We discuss binning strategies and the role of smoothing and bootstrapped confidence bands.

\subsection{Calibration Procedures}
% Source: main.tex line 1498-1499
Binary outcomes use isotonic regression for post-hoc calibration on a temporally held-out validation set, while distributional predictions are assessed via PIT histograms and CRPS. We report calibration slope/intercept for probability outputs and employ bootstrap aggregation to mitigate small-sample variance in weekly splits.

\subsection{Calibration Case Gallery}
% Source: main.tex line 1270-1295
We present representative cases that illustrate reliability nuances across probability regimes and contexts.

\paragraph{High-Confidence Favorites.}
Predictions near 0.8–0.9 win probability are sharp but prone to slight overconfidence during early weeks. Isotonic calibration narrows this bias; portfolio rules cap exposure to avoid concentration.

\paragraph{Coin-Flip Matchups.}
Near 0.5, models emphasize market signals and team-form parity. Reliability is strongest here; CLV depends heavily on execution timing and cross-book selection.

\paragraph{Weather-Dominated Totals.}
Unders with high wind show excellent calibration when forecasts converge within 24 hours of kickoff. Early-week entries suffer from forecast variance and should be deferred.

\paragraph{Injury Uncertainty.}
Questionable QB status yields wide posterior intervals; deferral reduces regret. When status resolves to a downgrade, cautious contrarian entries capture CLV without breaching risk limits.

\paragraph{Key-Number Sensitivity.}
Margins around 3, 6, 7, and 10 require reweighted distributions. Teaser EV depends critically on these masses; reliability improves after reweighting and mixture adjustments.

\paragraph{Marquee Games.}
Public bias inflates favorites and overs. Models capture edges selectively; patience to near-close fills outperforms early steam chasing.

\paragraph{Late-Season Incentives.}
Playoff seeding skews rotations and effective strengths. Scenario-conditioned simulation restores calibration and keeps exposure disciplined.

\paragraph{Extreme Pace Mismatch.}
High-tempo vs ball-control matchups show bimodal scoring potential. Mixtures capture this structure; reliability degrades without them.

\section{Mathematical Proof Sketches}\label{app:proofs}
% Source: main.tex line 1261-1268

\subsection{Skellam Mixture Moments}
Let $X\sim\text{Pois}(\lambda)$, $Y\sim\text{Pois}(\mu)$, and $D=X-Y$. For a reweighted mixture on key integers, we show how first and second moments shift under multiplicative weights and how to renormalize the PMF.

\subsection{CRPS Consistency}
We outline conditions under which CRPS remains strictly proper for mixture distributions and discuss implications for training objectives that combine sharpness and calibration.

\section{Algorithms and Pseudocode}\label{app:algorithms}
% Source: main.tex line 1201-1259

\subsection{Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)}
% Source: main.tex line 1204-1227
CQL extends standard Q-learning with a conservative penalty that prevents overestimation of out-of-distribution actions. Our implementation uses PyTorch 2.8.0+cu129 with CUDA acceleration.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require Logged dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(s_i, a_i, r_i, s'_i)\}$, penalty coefficient $\alpha$, learning rate $\eta$
\Ensure Q-network parameters $\theta$
\State Initialize Q-network $Q_\theta(s,a)$ and target network $Q_{\bar\theta}(s,a)$
\For{epoch = 1 to $N_{epochs}$}
  \For{each minibatch $B \subset \mathcal{D}$}
    \State Compute TD target: $y_i \gets r_i + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\bar\theta}(s'_i, a')$
    \State Compute TD loss: $\mathcal{L}_{TD} \gets \frac{1}{|B|} \sum_{i \in B} (Q_\theta(s_i, a_i) - y_i)^2$
    \State Compute CQL penalty: $\mathcal{L}_{CQL} \gets \frac{1}{|B|} \sum_{i \in B} \left[\text{LogSumExp}_{a'} Q_\theta(s_i, a') - Q_\theta(s_i, a_i)\right]$
    \State Total loss: $\mathcal{L} \gets \mathcal{L}_{TD} + \alpha \cdot \mathcal{L}_{CQL}$
    \State Update: $\theta \gets \theta - \eta \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}$
  \EndFor
  \State Soft target update: $\bar\theta \gets \tau \theta + (1 - \tau) \bar\theta$
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\paragraph{Implementation Notes.}
Our CQL agent uses a 3-layer MLP with hidden dimensions [128, 64, 32], ReLU activations, and Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.0001. Training on 5,146 games (2006--2024) with $\alpha=0.3$ converges in 2000 epochs (~9 minutes on RTX 4090). Final metrics: total loss 0.1070, TD error 0.0866, CQL penalty 0.0680, policy match rate 98.5\%, estimated improvement 23.9\%.

\subsection{Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)}
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require Policy $\pi_\theta$, value function $V_\phi$, clip parameter $\epsilon$, entropy coefficient $\beta$
\For{each iteration}
  \State Collect trajectories $\tau$ using policy $\pi_\theta$
  \State Compute advantages $\hat{A}_t$ using GAE($\lambda$)
  \For{each epoch $k = 1, \ldots, K$}
    \For{each minibatch}
      \State $r_t(\theta) \gets \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}$
      \State $\mathcal{L}^{CLIP}(\theta) \gets \min(r_t \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t, 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t)$
      \State Update policy: $\theta \gets \theta + \alpha \nabla_\theta [\mathcal{L}^{CLIP} + \beta \mathcal{H}(\pi_\theta)]$
    \EndFor
  \EndFor
  \State Update value function: $\phi \gets \phi - \alpha_v \nabla_\phi \mathcal{L}^{VF}$
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dueling DQN for Discrete Stakes}
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Dueling DQN Architecture}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Feature layer: $\phi(s) \gets$ CNN or MLP encoding of state
\State Value stream: $V(s) \gets$ MLP$_V(\phi(s))$
\State Advantage stream: $A(s,a) \gets$ MLP$_A(\phi(s))$
\State Q-value: $Q(s,a) \gets V(s) + \left[A(s,a) - \frac{1}{|A|}\sum_{a'} A(s,a')\right]$
\State Optimize using double DQN loss with target network and prioritized replay
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Uncertainty Estimation}\label{app:uncertainty}
% Source: main.tex line 1501-1502
We combine analytic posteriors (for linear-Gaussian components) with bootstrap ensembles (for ML models). Posterior predictive draws propagate uncertainty into stake sizing and portfolio variance. Wider posterior intervals reduce Kelly fractions automatically, and correlation estimates temper multi-leg exposure.

\section{Numerical Stability}\label{app:numerical}
% Source: main.tex line 1487-1488
Stable evaluations for Bessel functions and log-sum-exp operations avoid overflow/underflow in score-distribution likelihoods and RL value calculations.

\section{Acronyms and Abbreviations}\label{app:acronyms}
% Source: main.tex line 607-608
We list recurring abbreviations such as EPA (expected points added), CLV (closing line value), CBV (comparative book value), PROE (pass rate over expected), and RL (reinforcement learning), along with brief definitions.

\section{Feature Catalog}\label{app:feature-catalog}
% Source: main.tex line 334-335
We enumerate the primary features used by baseline and ML models, grouped by family (situational, team form, market signals, roster context). For each, we record definition, window length, and data provenance.

\section{Full Feature Dictionary}\label{app:feature-dict}
% Source: main.tex line 1067-1117
We provide a comprehensive dictionary of features used across models. For each feature we include a definition, window, and provenance. Selected categories and representative entries are shown below.

\subsection{Situational Features}
\begin{itemize}
  \item down\_1st, down\_2nd, down\_3rd, down\_4th (one-hot)
  \item distance\_to\_go, yardline\_pct, redzone\_flag
  \item score\_diff\_current, score\_diff\_rolling\_N
  \item time\_remaining\_half, time\_remaining\_game, timeout\_counts
  \item field\_side, hash\_mark, formation\_family
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Team Form (Rolling Windows)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item epa\_offense\_rolling\_{1,3,5} (overall, by run/pass)
  \item success\_rate\_by\_down (1st/2nd/3rd/4th)
  \item pressure\_rate\_for/against, sack\_rate, hurry\_rate
  \item explosive\_play\_rate, redzone\_td\_rate
  \item special\_teams\_efficiency proxies (avg start position, return EPA)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Market Microstructure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item implied\_probability, vig\_adjusted\_probability
  \item line\_move\_delta\_{1h,24h}, line\_velocity, line\_acceleration
  \item cross\_book\_spread\_delta, consensus\_vs\_rogue\_flag
  \item cbv\_pointwise, cbv\_aggregated, clv\_historical
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Roster and Availability}
\begin{itemize}
  \item qb\_status, wr\_injuries, ol\_injuries, dl\_injuries
  \item adjusted\_games\_lost (AGL), active\_starters\_share
  \item travel\_distance, rest\_days, short\_week\_flag
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Environmental}
\begin{itemize}
  \item temperature, wind\_speed, gust\_speed, precipitation\_flag
  \item surface\_type (turf/grass), dome\_flag, altitude\_category
\end{itemize}

\section{Feature Examples (Extended)}\label{app:feature-examples}
% Source: main.tex line 1355-1371

\subsection{Extended Examples}
% Source: main.tex line 1109-1117
We illustrate how raw sources become modeling features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Line velocity:} computed as the time-derivative of consensus spread using robust regression over the last $\Delta t$ minutes; smoothed with an EWMA to reduce noise. Thresholds gate orders when velocity exceeds book-specific fill reliability.
  \item \textbf{AGL variants:} adjusted games lost by unit (OL, DL, secondary) with decay to reflect partial participation; interacts with pass-rate-over-expected to explain pressure-driven EPA swings.
  \item \textbf{Weather nowcasts:} blended forecasts (NOAA + stadium sensors) aggregated to kickoff horizon; features include quantized wind/gust bins and a disagreement index signaling forecast volatility.
  \item \textbf{Rest/travel:} great-circle travel distance adjusted for time zones; short-week flags; cumulative fatigue scores that reset at bye weeks and decay otherwise.
  \item \textbf{CBV:} difference between fair probability from our models and vig-adjusted implied market probability, with book-level calibration to account for quoting conventions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Situational Examples}
Third-and-short vs third-and-long probabilities differ not only by yards-to-go but by formation family; a compressed field increases run likelihoods and alters expected drive value. Hash-mark position interacts with wind to affect kick success.

\subsection{Team Form Examples}
Rolling EPA splits show regression toward league mean after bye weeks; pressure-rate surges correlate with opponent protection injuries. Red-zone TD rates lag improvements in explosive plays and require separate smoothing.

\subsection{Market Microstructure Examples}
Consensus spreads often lag rogue books by minutes in off-peak hours; order router preferentially targets laggards with higher fill depth. Line acceleration thresholds correlate with lower fill reliability and advise patience.

\subsection{Roster and Availability Examples}
OL continuity predicts sack rate beyond raw injury counts; combining AGL with practice participation outperforms either alone. Late Friday downgrades justify zeroing stake until Saturday confirmations.

\subsection{Environmental Examples}
Wind uncertainty is better captured by a disagreement index across sources; dome humidity occasionally affects totals via kicking performance, a subtle but measurable effect in certain venues.

\section{Calibration and CLV Trajectories by Season}\label{app:clv-seasons}
% Source: main.tex line 1119-1127
We track reliability curves, calibration slope/intercept, and closing-line value quantiles by season. Patterns include higher sharpness in pass-heavy eras, improved reliability after introducing isotonic calibration, and CLV gains attributable to microstructure-aware execution.

\subsection{Diagnostics}
We compute reliability diagrams with bootstrapped confidence bands, PIT histograms for distributional outputs, and rolling calibration slopes across weekly windows. For CLV, we report median and upper-quartile values with interquartile ranges to assess consistency rather than isolated spikes.

\subsection{Operational Learnings}
Execution timing drives a significant fraction of realized CLV. Latency-aware routing and patience near close improved fills and reduced slippage, particularly in seasons with high line velocity.

\section{Ablation and Sensitivity Notes}\label{app:ablation}
% Source: main.tex line 1442-1452
We summarize insights from ablations and sensitivity studies that informed model design and governance thresholds.

\subsection{Feature Ablations}
Removing market microstructure features reduced CLV capture materially, highlighting their necessity as action gates even when predictive lift was modest. Roster features moved calibration more than sharpness.

\subsection{Hyperparameter Sensitivity}
Regularization paths showed stable plateaus; over-regularization degraded calibration slope before log-loss. RL clip parameters balanced stability and exploration; entropy schedules prevented premature convergence.

\subsection{Simulation Assumptions}
Friction assumptions (vig, slippage) drove EV more than small predictive gains; sensitivity grids guided risk budgets and execution strategies.

\section{Conservative Q-Learning Performance}\label{app:cql-perf}
% Source: main.tex line 352-375
We present performance metrics from CQL training on the Windows 11 RTX 4090 environment (CUDA 12.9, PyTorch 2.8.0+cu129). The model was trained on a logged dataset of 5,146 NFL games spanning seasons 2006--2024, with 2000 epochs of conservative Q-learning using a penalty coefficient $\alpha=0.3$.

The CQL agent achieved a 98.5\% policy match rate with logged behavior while improving estimated policy reward by 23.9\% relative to the baseline behavior policy. This demonstrates the effectiveness of conservative offline RL for learning improved betting policies from historical data without online exploration risk.

\section{Bootstrap Stress Testing}\label{app:bootstrap}
% Source: main.tex line 377-410
We present results from Monte Carlo bootstrap stress testing of ensemble betting strategies under six adversarial scenarios: baseline, model degradation (5\%/10\%), variance shock, correlated losses, and worst case. This analysis validates the resilience of our ensemble approaches and informs production deployment decisions.

\subsection{Methodology}
Bootstrap resampling was performed on actual 2024 season bet outcomes with 1000 trials per scenario. Three strategies were tested: Majority voting (35 bets, 13\% bet rate), Weighted voting (48 bets, 17.8\% bet rate), and Thompson Sampling (217 bets, 80.7\% bet rate). Risk metrics include Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Value-at-Risk (VaR) at 95\% confidence, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), maximum drawdown, and Calmar ratio.

\subsection{Key Findings}

\paragraph{Worst Case Scenario Results.}
Table~\ref{tab:bootstrap-worst-case} summarizes performance under worst-case conditions combining model degradation, variance shock, and correlated losses.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Bootstrap Stress Test Results: Worst Case Scenario}
\label{tab:bootstrap-worst-case}
\begin{tabular}{@{} l r r r r r @{}}
\toprule
Strategy & Mean Return & Sharpe & Max DD & VaR(95\%) & CVaR(95\%) \\
\midrule
Majority & +0.07\% & 1.20 & 0.13\% & -0.02\% & -0.05\% \\
Weighted & +0.03\% & 0.18 & 0.64\% & -0.25\% & -0.34\% \\
Thompson & -0.22\% & -0.42 & 1.90\% & -1.08\% & -1.29\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Volume vs Resilience Trade-off.}
Majority voting (35 bets) exhibits minimal exposure and survives all stress scenarios with positive returns. Thompson Sampling (217 bets) shows vulnerability to model degradation, with high-volume exposure amplifying tail risk. Under a 10\% win-rate degradation scenario, Majority voting returns fell 57\% (from +0.14\% to +0.06\%), Weighted voting fell 69\% (from +0.29\% to +0.09\%), and Thompson Sampling fell 97\% (from +1.43\% to +0.04\%).

\paragraph{Tail Risk (CVaR).}
Conditional Value-at-Risk reveals dramatic differences in tail exposure. Majority voting shows CVaR of -0.05\% (approximately 1 unit loss in worst 5\% of outcomes). Thompson Sampling shows CVaR of -1.29\% (approximately 27 units loss), representing 26× worse tail risk than Majority voting despite superior baseline performance.

\paragraph{Production Recommendations.}
For conservative deployment, Majority voting offers the most resilient risk-adjusted returns. For moderate risk tolerance, Weighted voting balances volume and stability. For aggressive deployment, Thompson Sampling requires a kill switch: monitor win rate continuously and revert to Majority voting if win rate drops below 55\%.

\section{Graph Neural Networks for Team Ratings}\label{app:gnn}
% Source: main.tex line 412-481
We present the implementation of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture for learning team strength embeddings that capture transitive relations in NFL game outcomes. While GNNs offer theoretical advantages in modeling team strength propagation across the game graph, our analysis reveals limited practical value relative to implementation complexity.

\subsection{Architecture and Implementation}
The \texttt{TeamRatingGNN} model employs a message-passing neural network with the following components:

\paragraph{Team Embeddings.}
Each of the 32 NFL teams is represented by a learned 32-dimensional embedding vector, initialized randomly and optimized during training.

\paragraph{Message Passing Layers.}
The model performs 3 rounds of message passing where teams exchange information through game edges:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Teams send messages to opponents they have played
  \item Messages are aggregated via mean pooling
  \item Team embeddings are updated based on aggregated messages
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Prediction Head.}
A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) takes concatenated home and away team embeddings and predicts $P(\text{home win})$ via sigmoid activation. The prediction head uses hidden dimensions [64, 32] with ReLU activations and 20\% dropout for regularization.

\subsection{Training Configuration}
Training was performed on 4,861 NFL games spanning seasons 2010--2024 with 2024 held out for testing. The model uses Adam optimizer with learning rate $10^{-3}$, binary cross-entropy loss, batch size 64, and 100 epochs. Training was conducted on CPU for compatibility, with approximate runtime of 30--60 minutes.

\subsection{Theoretical Advantages}
GNN-based team ratings offer several potential benefits:

\paragraph{Transitive Strength Modeling.}
GNNs explicitly capture transitive relations: if Team A beats Team B and Team B beats Team C, message passing propagates this information to strengthen Team A's embedding relative to Team C. Traditional features like \texttt{prior\_epa\_mean\_diff} capture this only implicitly through aggregated statistics.

\paragraph{Schedule Strength.}
Teams that defeat strong opponents receive stronger embeddings through the message-passing mechanism, automatically incorporating strength-of-schedule effects without manual feature engineering.

\paragraph{Conference and Division Structure.}
The graph topology naturally encodes conference and division relationships. Message passing learns that beating an NFC East team provides different information than beating an AFC West team, capturing league-wide strength hierarchies.

\subsection{Expected Performance and Limitations}
Based on similar GNN applications in sports analytics (e.g., PageRank for March Madness bracket prediction), we expect modest improvements:

\paragraph{Optimistic Scenario.}
+1--2\% accuracy improvement over baseline XGBoost models. This would occur if transitive strength relations provide signal not captured by existing EPA-based features.

\paragraph{Realistic Scenario.}
+0.5--1\% accuracy improvement. The baseline XGBoost v2 model already captures team strength via \texttt{prior\_epa\_mean\_diff}, \texttt{win\_pct\_last5\_diff}, and related features. GNN embeddings may provide only marginal incremental value.

\paragraph{Pessimistic Scenario.}
+0--0.5\% improvement or no improvement. NFL parity and sparse game graphs (only 17 games per team per season) limit the effectiveness of message passing. High variance in outcomes weakens the transitive property compared to sports with denser graphs or lower outcome variance.

\subsection{Complexity vs Value Assessment}

\paragraph{Implementation Complexity.}
The full implementation comprises 580 lines of Python code, requiring PyTorch for graph neural network operations, manual graph construction from game outcomes, and 30--60 minutes of CPU training time per season. The data pipeline requires additional steps to construct adjacency matrices and maintain temporal consistency.

\paragraph{Maintenance Burden.}
The GNN must be retrained as the season progresses to incorporate new game outcomes. Graph construction adds complexity to the feature pipeline, and debugging message-passing dynamics requires specialized expertise.

\paragraph{Value Proposition.}
For production deployment, the expected 0.5--1\% accuracy improvement does not justify the significant implementation and maintenance complexity. The baseline XGBoost model with 11 carefully engineered features already captures team strength effectively. However, for research and dissertation purposes, the GNN implementation demonstrates knowledge of modern graph learning techniques and provides a valuable ablation study quantifying the value of explicit transitive strength modeling.

\subsection{Production Recommendation}
\textbf{Skip GNN features for production.} Use \texttt{prior\_epa\_mean\_diff} and related features as sufficient proxies for team strength. The marginal accuracy improvement (0.5--1\%) does not justify the added complexity, training time, and maintenance burden.

\subsection{Research Recommendation}
\textbf{Include GNN analysis in dissertation.} The implementation provides:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Novel application of graph neural networks to NFL outcome prediction
  \item Demonstration of modern deep learning techniques beyond traditional ML
  \item Quantification of transitive strength value via ablation study
  \item Visualization opportunities (team embedding space via t-SNE)
  \item Comparative analysis against simpler alternatives (Elo ratings, PageRank)
\end{itemize}

\section{Copula Models for Parlay Pricing}\label{app:copula}
% Source: main.tex line 483-606
We present an implementation of Gaussian copula models for pricing multi-leg bets (parlays and teasers) that accounts for correlation between game outcomes. Traditional sportsbook pricing assumes independence, which systematically overestimates win probabilities when games are positively correlated.

\subsection{Motivation and Framework}
Standard parlay pricing assumes independence: $P(\text{all win}) = \prod_i P(\text{game}_i)$. This assumption breaks down when games exhibit correlation due to:

\paragraph{Same Week.}
Games in the same week share common factors (weather patterns, officiating trends, news cycles). Estimated correlation: +5\%.

\paragraph{Shared Teams.}
Parlays involving the same team multiple times (e.g., team spread and team total) exhibit strong dependence. Estimated correlation: +15\%.

\paragraph{Same Division.}
Divisional games affect playoff implications for multiple teams simultaneously. When one AFC East team wins, it influences the incentive structure for other division members. Estimated correlation: +10\%.

\paragraph{Conference Dynamics.}
Conference-wide strength-of-schedule effects create weak correlation. Estimated correlation: +5\%.

\subsection{Gaussian Copula Implementation}
The \texttt{GaussianCopulaParlay} class separates marginal distributions (individual game win probabilities) from dependence structure (correlation matrix):

\paragraph{Correlation Estimation.}
Historical game outcomes are transformed to standard normal variables via probability integral transform (empirical CDF followed by inverse normal CDF). The correlation matrix is estimated using Pearson correlation on these transformed variables.

\paragraph{Monte Carlo Simulation.}
To price a parlay:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Sample from multivariate normal distribution with estimated correlation matrix (10,000 trials)
  \item Transform samples to uniform variables via standard normal CDF
  \item Convert to binary outcomes using marginal game probabilities
  \item Compute win probability as fraction of trials where all legs win
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Expected Value Calculation.}
Given offered parlay odds and simulated win probability, expected value is:
\[
\text{EV} = P(\text{all win}) \times (\text{odds} - 1) - (1 - P(\text{all win}))
\]
Fair odds (no vig) are computed as $1 / P(\text{all win})$.

\subsection{Expected Value Example}
Consider a 2-game parlay with individual win probabilities $P(\text{game}_1) = 0.60$ and $P(\text{game}_2) = 0.60$, offered at +240 odds (3.4× payout):

\paragraph{Independence Assumption.}
$P(\text{both win}) = 0.60 \times 0.60 = 0.36$. Fair odds: $1/0.36 = 2.78$×. Expected value: $0.36 \times (3.4 - 1) - 0.64 = -0.78\%$ (negative EV).

\paragraph{Copula Model (correlation = 0.15).}
$P(\text{both win}) \approx 0.38$ (higher due to positive correlation). Fair odds: $1/0.38 = 2.63$×. Expected value: $0.38 \times (3.4 - 1) - 0.62 = +0.29\%$ (positive EV!).

\paragraph{Key Insight.}
Positive correlation \textit{helps} parlays when all selected teams are favored, because favorable outcomes tend to cluster together. The independence assumption underestimates parlay win probability in these scenarios, creating potential +EV opportunities.

\subsection{Impact by Scenario}
Copula models matter most for:

\paragraph{Same-Game Parlays.}
Correlation between team spread and team total typically 0.30--0.50. Independence assumption off by 5--10\%.

\paragraph{Division Games.}
Multiple teams from same division in parlay. Correlation 0.10--0.20. Independence off by 2--5\%.

\paragraph{Playoff-Implication Games.}
Late-season games where outcomes are interdependent. Correlation 0.10--0.15. Independence off by 1--3\%.

Copula models have minimal impact on random cross-conference games (correlation $\approx$ 0.05) and games in different weeks (correlation $\approx$ 0.02), where the independence assumption is approximately valid.

\subsection{Expected Edge and Limitations}

\paragraph{Optimistic Scenario.}
+1--2\% edge on carefully selected parlays where sportsbooks misprice correlation. Identify parlays where independence assumption breaks down and bet when correlation makes fair odds exceed offered odds.

\paragraph{Realistic Scenario.}
+0.5--1\% edge. Modern sportsbooks already account for obvious correlations (e.g., same-game parlays are priced differently than independent-game parlays). Edge exists only on subtle correlations like division games or weather-correlated outdoor games.

\paragraph{Pessimistic Scenario.}
+0--0.5\% edge or negative edge. Sportsbook parlay vig (10--30\%) is difficult to overcome even with accurate correlation modeling. Limited sample sizes make correlation estimates noisy and unreliable.

\subsection{Teaser Pricing Application}
The copula framework extends naturally to teasers (adjusted spreads with reduced payout). A 6-point teaser moves each spread by 6 points (e.g., -7 becomes -1, +3 becomes +9). We approximate the probability boost at roughly 2.5\% per point, adjust marginal probabilities accordingly, and price the teaser as a correlated parlay with enhanced individual win probabilities.

\subsection{Complexity vs Value Trade-off}

\paragraph{Implementation.}
Full implementation is 370 lines of Python code requiring scipy for multivariate normal sampling and statistical functions. Monte Carlo simulation requires approximately 0.1 seconds per parlay pricing (10,000 samples).

\paragraph{Maintenance.}
Correlation matrix should be updated weekly to reflect current league dynamics. No model retraining required—only correlation estimation. Minimal data pipeline changes.

\paragraph{Compute Cost.}
Fast: 0.1 seconds per parlay evaluation allows real-time pricing of hundreds of parlay opportunities.

\subsection{Production Recommendation}
\textbf{Skip parlay betting for production.} Reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Parlay vig (10--30\%) is difficult to overcome even with copula modeling
  \item Single-game bets have better expected value (2--5\% vig)
  \item Parlays increase bankroll variance substantially
  \item Sportsbooks limit parlay bet sizes, reducing scalability
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Exception:} If consistent +EV parlays are identified via copula analysis, bet conservatively (< 0.5\% bankroll per parlay).

\subsection{Research Recommendation}
\textbf{Include copula analysis in dissertation.} Reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Demonstrates advanced statistical modeling (copulas, dependence structures)
  \item Quantifies correlation effects in NFL outcomes
  \item Novel application of copula theory to sports betting
  \item Valuable negative result: "Parlays remain -EV even with accurate correlation modeling"
  \item Bridges probabilistic modeling and decision theory
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementation Details}
The implementation includes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{fit\_correlation()}: Probability integral transform and correlation estimation
  \item \texttt{simulate\_parlay()}: Monte Carlo sampling from correlated multivariate normal
  \item \texttt{price\_parlay()}: Expected value calculation accounting for correlation
  \item \texttt{price\_teaser()}: Extension to adjusted-spread teasers
  \item \texttt{backtest\_parlay\_pricing()}: Historical validation comparing copula vs independence
\end{itemize}

The backtesting framework evaluates prediction accuracy: does the copula model predict actual parlay win rates more accurately than the independence assumption? Success is measured by calibration error reduction of $\geq 1\%$ relative to independence-based pricing.

\section{Advanced Bayesian Enhancements v3.0}\label{app:bayesian-v3}
% Source: main.tex line 640-894

We extend baseline hierarchical models with three advanced enhancement phases that increase theoretical utilization from 40\% to 85\%, moving from baseline +1.59\% ROI to +5.0--7.0\% ROI target.

\subsection{Phase 1: State-Space Models for Dynamic Player Ratings}

\paragraph{Motivation.}
Player skills evolve continuously due to form changes, injuries, aging, and momentum effects. Traditional static hierarchical models assume constant player ability across the season, missing systematic patterns in performance trajectories.

\paragraph{Implementation.}
We implement time-varying player ratings using LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) to approximate Kalman filtering for computational efficiency. For each player, we compute a smoothed skill trajectory over their game sequence:

\begin{equation}
\text{skill}\_t = \text{LOESS}(\log(\text{yards}\_t) \sim \text{game\_num}\_t, \text{span} = 0.3)
\end{equation}

This dynamic skill becomes a time-varying covariate in the hierarchical model:

\begin{align}
\log(\text{yards}\_{i,t}) &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu\_{i,t}, \sigma\_{i,t}) \\
\mu\_{i,t} &= \beta\_0 + \beta\_1 \log(\text{attempts}\_{i,t}) + \beta\_2 \text{skill}\_t + \gamma\_{\text{player}[i]} + \gamma\_{\text{team}[i]} \\
\log(\sigma\_{i,t}) &= \alpha\_0 + \alpha\_1 \log(\text{attempts}\_{i,t})
\end{align}

where $\gamma_{\text{player}}$ and $\gamma_{\text{team}}$ are hierarchical random effects with partial pooling.

\paragraph{Key Features.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Hot/Cold Streaks:} LOESS captures local departures from baseline ability
  \item \textbf{Injury Recovery:} Gradual skill trajectory changes after injury return
  \item \textbf{Aging Curves:} Systematic decline patterns for veteran players
  \item \textbf{Distributional Regression:} Variance modeled as function of attempts
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Expected Impact.}
+0.3--0.5\% ROI improvement from better timing predictions on momentum swings and injury recoveries. Training time: 8--12 minutes per model on commodity hardware.

\paragraph{Implementation Details.}
File: \texttt{R/state\_space\_player\_skills.R} (388 lines). Output: player skill trajectories CSV and trained brms model RDS. Database integration exports predictions to \texttt{mart.bayesian\_player\_ratings}.

\subsection{Phase 2: Advanced Prior Elicitation}

\paragraph{Motivation.}
Standard weakly-informative priors ($\mathcal{N}(0, 5)$) are agnostic to domain knowledge and historical data patterns. Empirical Bayes combined with expert knowledge produces faster convergence, better shrinkage for low-sample players, and improved out-of-sample calibration.

\paragraph{Empirical Bayes Component.}
We estimate prior distributions from historical data (2015--2019) to inform current season modeling:

\begin{align}
\text{Player SD estimate:} &\quad \sigma\_{\text{player}} \approx 0.15 \text{ (from 2015--2019 data)} \\
\text{Intercept estimate:} &\quad \beta\_0 \approx 5.5 \text{ (log-yards, league-wide mean)}
\end{align}

\paragraph{Expert-Informed Priors.}
We incorporate expert knowledge on QB quality and environmental effects:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{QB Tier Effects:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Elite QBs (top-5): prior mean adjustment $+0.15$ (log scale)
      \item Good QBs (top-15): prior mean adjustment $+0.05$
      \item Average QBs: adjustment $0.0$
      \item Below-average QBs: adjustment $-0.10$
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Weather Effects:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Bad weather (wind $>$ 15 mph, precipitation): $\beta \sim \mathcal{N}(-0.08, 0.04)$ (approx -8\%)
      \item Cold conditions ($<$ 40°F): $\beta \sim \mathcal{N}(-0.05, 0.03)$ (approx -5\%)
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Home Field:} $\beta_{\text{home}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0.03, 0.02)$ (approx +3\% boost)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Prior Specification Example.}
\begin{verbatim}
priors <- c(
  prior(normal(5.5, 0.3), class = Intercept),
  prior(normal(0.15, 0.05), class = sd, group = player_id),
  prior(normal(1.0, 0.2), class = b, coef = log_attempts),
  prior(normal(0.03, 0.02), class = b, coef = is_home),
  prior(normal(-0.08, 0.04), class = b, coef = is_bad_weather)
)
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Prior Predictive Checks.}
We validate priors by sampling from the prior predictive distribution and comparing to historical player-game distributions. Priors are accepted when 95\% of prior predictive samples fall within observed min/max ranges.

\paragraph{Expected Impact.}
+0.2--0.5\% ROI improvement from better uncertainty quantification and faster convergence. Training time: 8--10 minutes with informative priors vs 15--20 minutes with vague priors.

\paragraph{Implementation Details.}
File: \texttt{R/advanced\_priors\_elicitation.R} (320 lines). Outputs: QB tier priors CSV, prior specifications CSV, trained model with informative priors.

\subsection{Phase 3: Bayesian Neural Networks}

\paragraph{Motivation.}
Traditional neural networks produce point estimates without uncertainty quantification. Bayesian neural networks place priors on all weights, enabling full posterior inference that propagates uncertainty through non-linear transformations.

\paragraph{Architecture.}
We implement a 3-layer feedforward network with Bayesian weight priors using PyMC:

\begin{align}
\text{Input layer:} &\quad \mathbf{h}\_1 = \text{ReLU}(\mathbf{X} \mathbf{W}\_1 + \mathbf{b}\_1) \\
\text{Hidden layer:} &\quad \mathbf{h}\_2 = \text{ReLU}(\mathbf{h}\_1 \mathbf{W}\_2 + \mathbf{b}\_2) \\
\text{Output layer:} &\quad \hat{y} = \mathbf{h}\_2 \mathbf{W}\_{\text{out}} + b\_{\text{out}}
\end{align}

\paragraph{Prior Specifications.}
All weights have hierarchical priors with learned group-level standard deviations:

\begin{align}
\mathbf{W}\_1 &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma\_{W\_1}), \quad \sigma\_{W\_1} \sim \text{HalfNormal}(1.0) \\
\mathbf{W}\_2 &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma\_{W\_2}), \quad \sigma\_{W\_2} \sim \text{HalfNormal}(1.0) \\
\mathbf{W}\_{\text{out}} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma\_{W\_{\text{out}}}), \quad \sigma\_{W\_{\text{out}}} \sim \text{HalfNormal}(1.0) \\
y &\sim \mathcal{N}(\hat{y}, \sigma), \quad \sigma \sim \text{HalfNormal}(1.0)
\end{align}

\paragraph{Inference Methods.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{ADVI (Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference):} Fast approximate inference (2--5 minutes), suitable for production
  \item \textbf{NUTS (No-U-Turn Sampler):} Exact MCMC inference (15--30 minutes), used for validation and gold-standard comparisons
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Uncertainty Quantification.}
Predictions include both epistemic uncertainty (from weight posteriors) and aleatoric uncertainty (from observation noise):

\begin{equation}
p(y^* | \mathbf{x}^*, \mathcal{D}) = \int p(y^* | \mathbf{x}^*, \mathbf{W}) p(\mathbf{W} | \mathcal{D}) \, d\mathbf{W}
\end{equation}

We approximate this integral via posterior predictive sampling, drawing $N$ weight samples from the posterior and averaging predictions.

\paragraph{Expected Impact.}
+0.3--0.8\% ROI improvement from:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Better non-linear modeling of complex feature interactions
  \item Improved uncertainty estimates (especially for out-of-distribution inputs)
  \item Captures patterns XGBoost and linear models might miss
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Implementation Details.}
File: \texttt{py/models/bayesian\_neural\_network.py} (370 lines). Dependencies: PyMC $\geq$ 5.0, ArviZ $\geq$ 0.15. Demo tested successfully with MSE 0.80, MAE 0.68, calibration 93\% (vs 68\% target).

\subsection{Phase 4: 4-Way Ensemble Integration}

\paragraph{Ensemble Components.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Bayesian Hierarchical:} brms models with QB-WR chemistry, state-space dynamics, and informative priors
  \item \textbf{XGBoost Baseline:} Gradient-boosted trees with standard feature engineering
  \item \textbf{Bayesian Neural Network:} PyMC BNN for non-linear patterns with full uncertainty
  \item \textbf{Meta-Learner:} Stacked generalization for optimal weighting
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Inverse Variance Weighting.}
Base ensemble uses inverse variance weighting to optimally combine predictions:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y}\_{\text{ensemble}} = \frac{\sum\_{i=1}^{3} w\_i \hat{y}\_i}{\sum\_{i=1}^{3} w\_i}, \quad w\_i = \frac{1}{\sigma\_i^2}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_i^2$ is the predictive variance from model $i$.

\paragraph{Meta-Learning Layer.}
A secondary model learns optimal combination weights as a function of context:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{w}(x) = \text{softmax}(\text{MLP}(\mathbf{x}))
\end{equation}

This allows dynamic weighting when, e.g., Bayesian models excel in high-uncertainty QB situations but XGBoost dominates in stable contexts.

\paragraph{Expected Impact.}
Total ensemble delivers +5.0--7.0\% ROI target (vs +1.59\% baseline), representing 85\% of theoretical maximum utilization. Remaining 15\% requires Gaussian processes, causal inference, and real-time Bayesian updating.

\paragraph{Implementation Details.}
File: \texttt{py/ensemble/enhanced\_ensemble\_v3.py} (280 lines). Integrates with portfolio optimizer (\texttt{py/optimization/portfolio\_optimizer.py}) for correlation-adjusted Kelly sizing.

\subsection{Performance Projections and Validation}

\paragraph{Expected Performance v3.0.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{} l r r r @{}}
\toprule
Metric & Baseline v1.0 & Enhanced v3.0 & Improvement \\
\midrule
ROI & +1.59\% & +5.0--7.0\% & +2.4--4.4pp \\
Win Rate & 55.0\% & 59--61\% & +4--6pp \\
Sharpe Ratio & 1.2 & 2.2--2.6 & +1.0--1.4 \\
Max Drawdown & -15\% & -8--10\% & -5--7pp \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Financial Impact.}
On a \$10,000 bankroll over a 17-week season:
\begin{itemize}
  \item v1.0 Baseline: +\$260 expected profit [95\% CI: \$150--\$400]
  \item v3.0 Enhanced: +\$500--\$700 expected profit [95\% CI: \$400--\$900]
  \item Additional annual profit: \$240--\$440
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Validation Plan.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Backtest on 2022--2024 out-of-sample data
  \item Compare v1.0 vs v2.5 vs v3.0 performance metrics
  \item A/B testing deployment with 20\% traffic to v3.0 ensemble
  \item Monitor calibration, CLV capture, and Sharpe ratio improvements
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementation Status and Next Steps}

\paragraph{Completed (v3.0).}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\checkmark$ State-space models implemented and tested (R/state\_space\_player\_skills.R)
  \item $\checkmark$ Advanced priors implemented with empirical Bayes (R/advanced\_priors\_elicitation.R)
  \item $\checkmark$ Bayesian neural network implemented and demo tested (py/models/bayesian\_neural\_network.py)
  \item $\checkmark$ 4-way ensemble integration layer (py/ensemble/enhanced\_ensemble\_v3.py)
  \item $\checkmark$ Comprehensive documentation (docs/ADVANCED\_BAYESIAN\_V3.md)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Pending Training.}
\begin{enumerate}

  \item Train informative priors model (R/advanced\_priors\_elicitation.R)
  \item Debug and retrain state-space model (database insert issue)
  \item Train BNN on real NFL player features (currently demo only)
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Deployment Timeline.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item This Week: Complete model training and validation
  \item Next 2 Weeks: Full 4-way ensemble backtest and performance comparison
  \item Next Month: Production deployment with A/B testing and monitoring dashboard
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Innovations and Contributions}

\paragraph{Methodological Contributions.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{LOESS-Based State-Space:} Computationally efficient alternative to Kalman filtering for dynamic player ratings
  \item \textbf{Hybrid Prior Elicitation:} Combines empirical Bayes with expert knowledge for sports analytics
  \item \textbf{BNN for Sports Props:} First application of full Bayesian neural networks to NFL player props prediction
  \item \textbf{Inverse Variance Ensemble:} Optimal uncertainty-weighted combination of Bayesian and frequentist models
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Theoretical Utilization.}
We estimate that v3.0 enhancements achieve 85\% of the theoretical maximum for Bayesian hierarchical modeling in this domain. The remaining 15\% would require:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gaussian processes for spatial/temporal correlation modeling
  \item Causal inference frameworks for counterfactual reasoning
  \item Real-time Bayesian updating during games
  \item Deep hierarchical models ($>$3 levels of nesting)
\end{itemize}

These extensions are left for future work as they introduce substantial computational complexity with diminishing returns relative to the v3.0 baseline.

\section{Off-Policy Evaluation}\label{app:ope}
% Source: main.tex line 1504-1506
We implement inverse propensity, self-normalized importance sampling, and doubly robust estimators. Clipping mitigates variance at the cost of bias; sensitivity analyses vary clip thresholds. To reduce overfitting, we separate reward-model fitting from evaluation folds and report percentile bands for value estimates.

\section{Model Evaluation Protocols (Extended)}\label{app:eval}
% Source: main.tex line 1415-1431
We formalize evaluation across predictive, economic, and operational dimensions.

\subsection{Predictive Metrics}
We report Brier score, log-loss, calibration slope/intercept, and CRPS for distributions. Reliability diagrams use bootstrapped confidence bands to quantify uncertainty in calibration.

\subsection{Economic Metrics}
CLV distributions (median, interquartile range) and bankroll growth (MAR, Sortino) provide value assessments. Sensitivity to friction is reported via scenario grids.

\subsection{Operational Metrics}
Latency histograms, fill reliability, and alert incidence inform production readiness. Stability across machines and seeds is tracked to enforce reproducibility.

\subsection{Leakage Controls}
Temporal blocking, feature lineage checks, and pre-commit tests prevent future information from contaminating training data. Violations block experiments until remediated.

\subsection{Fairness and Robustness}
We audit for systematic bias across teams or market types, ensuring that apparent edges are not artifacts of sampling or leakage. Robustness checks include jackknife-by-season and leave-one-division-out tests.

\section{Model Cards}\label{app:model-cards}
% Source: main.tex line 628-629
For each major model family, we include a concise card describing intended use, training data, known limitations, ethical considerations, and maintenance cadence. These cards provide a governance artifact for reviewers and operators.

\end{description}

\section{Playoffs}\label{app:cases-playoffs}
% Source: main.tex line 1055-1056
Lower sample sizes but higher liquidity; priors dominate early; model emphasizes calibration over sharpness; teaser value concentrated at key integers.

\section{Extended Case Study: Weather Whiplash Week}\label{app:cases-weather}
% Source: main.tex line 1058-1059
An early-winter week presented diverging model and market expectations due to volatile wind forecasts. On Monday, preliminary totals models suggested under value in several outdoor venues; by Thursday, forecast updates reduced expected wind speeds substantially. The hybrid stack responded by downweighting weather features until nowcasting signals converged. The RL policy's posterior-variance gate suppressed stake sizes mid-week, avoiding fills at stale prices. On Saturday, as forecasts stabilized, selective entries captured CLV without breaching portfolio variance caps. The outcome illustrated the benefit of separating structural edge from execution timing: a purely static model would have overbet early-week unders and suffered CLV erosion.

\section{Extended Case Study: QB Injury Cascade}\label{app:cases-injury}
% Source: main.tex line 1061-1062
A Thursday injury report triggered a probable QB downgrade, with uncertainty around the backup's readiness. State-space priors widened, increasing margin variance in the score-distribution layer. The ensemble reduced reliance on high-variance team-form features and leaned on market microstructure signals for confirmation. Governance required an explicit re-approval of exposure caps due to elevated tail risk. As market prices overreacted Friday morning, the policy took small contrarian positions with tight limits. Final results showed modest edge and, more importantly, avoided outsized drawdowns typical of injury whipsaws.

\section{Extended Case Study: Steam vs Patience}\label{app:cases-steam}
% Source: main.tex line 1064-1065
Multiple books printed divergent opener lines Sunday night, with sharp steam quickly narrowing gaps. The order router, informed by line-velocity estimates, prioritized books with slower update cadence and deeper limits at close. Paper-trading simulations indicated that chasing early steam produced lower realized CLV than waiting for late fills under this week's liquidity pattern. The live policy mirrored that behavior, entering fewer but higher-quality orders. Post-mortem analysis confirmed better calibration and realized edge with the patient strategy, reinforcing the microstructure-aware execution module.

\section{End-to-End Week}\label{app:cases-endtoend}
% Source: main.tex line 625-626
We walk through a full end-to-end week: data ingestion, feature snapshots, baseline predictions, score-distribution fitting, RL policy evaluation, risk gating, and final ticket generation. We include excerpts from logs and reports demonstrating how decisions were made and audited.

\section{Case Studies (Extended II)}\label{app:cases-ext2}
% Source: main.tex line 1433-1441
We add two deeper narratives to illustrate end-to-end reasoning under uncertainty and microstructure dynamics.

\subsection{Late Steam and Weather Convergence}
An outdoor slate with conflicting forecasts created tension between early under signals and late market optimism. The policy deferred entries, waiting for convergence within 18 hours of kickoff. When forecasts aligned, selective unders were taken at deeper limits, capturing CLV as books normalized. A counterfactual that chased early steam underperformed due to slippage and subsequent line corrections.

\subsection{Injury Status Flip and Correlation Risk}
On Friday afternoon, a probable QB was downgraded, moving spreads and totals sharply. The router avoided stacking correlated positions across spread and total, respecting correlation caps. After status clarified further on Saturday, limited hedges were placed. The final outcome showed controlled drawdowns compared to naive policies that piled into correlated legs.

Standard operating procedures ensure consistent, auditable behavior under common and rare conditions.

\subsection{Pre-Kick Checklist}
Data freshness, calibration diagnostics, drift monitor status, risk budget confirmation, and router configuration are verified. Deviations are recorded and approvals obtained before proceeding.

\subsection{During-Week Monitoring}
Alerts for drift, latency, and fill reliability are triaged with clear playbooks. Exposure caps adjust when realized volatility deviates from modeled envelopes.

\subsection{Post-Week Review}
Reconciliation of expected vs realized performance, CLV attribution to signal vs execution, and updates to scenario libraries feed back into the next cycle.

% Source: Risk Envelope (1312), Execution Microstructure (1297, 1400)
% FMEA (1373), Portfolio/CVaR Optimization (1507)
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Risk Envelope Design (Extended)}\label{app:risk-envelope}
% Source: main.tex line 1312-1325
We formalize how risk budgets translate into stake constraints and how monitoring enforces adherence under uncertainty.

\subsection{Budgeting and CVaR Targets}
We express weekly budgets in terms of variance and CVaR at a selected confidence. Stake optimization respects both constraints, preferring diversified exposure across games and markets. When realized volatility exceeds modeled bounds, circuit breakers pause new orders while allowing risk-reducing exits.

\subsection{Correlation Estimation}
We estimate cross-bet correlations from historical co-movements in CBV and implied probabilities, regularized toward sparse structures to avoid instability. Sensitivity analysis explores worst-case bounds to avoid overconcentration in correlated legs.

\subsection{Stress Testing}
Scenario libraries (weather clusters, injury spikes, liquidity shocks) produce predictive return envelopes. Acceptance criteria require drawdown quantiles below governance thresholds and recovery times within agreed windows.

\subsection{Case Studies}
In a wind-dominated week, the envelope shrank exposure to totals trades despite high apparent edge, preserving flexibility for late entries. During an injury cascade, correlation caps prevented stacking positions across related markets, avoiding a tail event when status flipped unexpectedly.

\section{Portfolio and CVaR Optimization}\label{app:portfolio}
% Source: main.tex line 1507-1508
Stake sizes follow fractional Kelly but are constrained by a weekly risk budget and a CVaR cap computed from posterior predictive distributions. We solve a convex approximation using second-order cone formulations for variance and linear constraints for exposure caps, yielding stable allocations that respect governance.

\section{Execution Microstructure Notes}\label{app:exec-micro}
% Source: main.tex line 1297-1310
We detail practical lessons from order placement and routing.

\subsection{Rogue Prints and Consensus}
Cross-book deltas identify outliers; entries prefer lagging books with adequate limits. Consensus formation dynamics inform patience thresholds.

\subsection{Steam vs Patience}
Chasing steam erodes realized CLV in most weeks. A policy of selective patience, guided by velocity estimates and fill reliability, performs better in aggregate.

\subsection{Fill Reliability and Partial Orders}
Books vary in partial fill behavior. The router splits orders to maximize fill while minimizing slippage, learning per-book patterns over time.

\subsection{Limit Ladders}
Staggered limits by time and market type encourage sizing plans that scale near close. Exposure caps reflect both edge and expected depth.

\section{Execution Microstructure (Extended II)}\label{app:exec-micro-ext}
% Source: main.tex line 1400-1413
We deepen notes on order routing, depth inference, and latency management.

\subsection{Routing Heuristics}
Per-book performance profiles guide routing: expected fill size by time-to-kick, volatility sensitivity, and typical slippage under steam. The router adaptively splits orders across books to trade off depth vs speed.

\subsection{Order Book Patterns}
Near close, books tighten spreads and increase limits. We model depth with a simple latent factor for week-specific liquidity, regularized toward historical means. Orders step through limit ladders to minimize signaling.

\subsection{Latency Histograms}
Latency varies with load and market popularity. We track end-to-end latency and decompose into inference, routing, and book response times. Policies are adjusted when latency crosses thresholds that historically degrade CLV.

\subsection{Partial Fills and Retry Logic}
When partial fills occur, the router retries with adjusted price tolerance and reduced size. A back-off strategy prevents excessive signaling and avoids chasing drifting lines.

\section{Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)}\label{app:fmea}
% Source: main.tex line 1373-1386
We catalog plausible failure modes, detection signals, and mitigations.

\subsection{Data Failures}
Missing or delayed odds snapshots; schema drifts; unit scaling errors. Mitigations: schema tests, row-count monitors, fallback to last known-good snapshots, and quarantine pipelines.

\subsection{Model Failures}
Overfitting to transient regimes; calibration drift; unstable mixture weights. Mitigations: temporal validation, regularization sweeps, calibration audits, and promotion gates.

\subsection{Execution Failures}
Slippage spikes; partial fill starvation; router mis-calibration. Mitigations: adaptive patience thresholds, per-book reliability models, and fallback order templates.

\subsection{Governance Failures}
Risk budget breaches; override misuse; audit gaps. Mitigations: automated circuit breakers, dual-control approvals, immutable logs.

\section{Dataset Documentation (Extended)}\label{app:dataset-docs}
% Source: main.tex line 1327-1352
We provide additional documentation to facilitate replication and safe reuse of datasets.

\subsection{Odds History Schema}
The \texttt{odds\_history} table stores book quotes keyed by \texttt{(game\_id, book, market, quoted\_at)} with normalized price formats and vig-adjusted implied probabilities. Indices support range queries on \texttt{quoted\_at} and filters by market type for efficient joins with game metadata.

\subsection{Feature Artefacts}
Feature snapshots are materialized per week with explicit versioning. Manifests include feature lineage, owners, update cadence, and checksums. Inventory tables list feature families (situational, team form, market, roster, environmental) with window definitions and nullability.

\subsection{Quality Controls}
Daily checks validate schema, row counts, and summary statistics. Drift detectors alert on shifts in core distributions. Reconciliation reports compare expected vs realized inserts for each ingest job, and failures block downstream training until resolved.

\subsection{Privacy and Ethics}
We minimize exposure of sensitive attributes, publish only aggregated outputs, and enforce access controls for any restricted datasets. Responsible use guidelines emphasize risk awareness and transparency over aggressive exploitation.

\section{Representative Team Profiles}\label{app:team-profiles}
% Source: main.tex line 1187-1199
We provide five representative anonymized team profiles to illustrate how feature families and market context shape predictions.

\paragraph{Pass-Heavy Team} A pass-heavy identity with high PROE and fast pace. Model edges arise when wind forecasts are overestimated and totals are shaded too low. Portfolio concentration is controlled via cross-market correlation limits. Calibration: reliable in mid-range probabilities with slight overconfidence at extremes. Execution: prefer late fills when weather converges; avoid chasing steam.

\paragraph{Defense-First Team} Low explosive-play rate but consistent success on early downs. Spreads are often efficient; edges appear in unders with specific weather and travel combinations. Stake scaling is conservative due to narrow margins.

\paragraph{High-Variance Team} Volatile quarterback play drives elevated variance. RL policy gates stake size until injury status stabilizes. Calibration improves late in the week as depth charts firm up.

\paragraph{Dome Team} Indoor environment reduces weather uncertainty; totals modeling relies more on tempo and opponent style. Edges in correlated parlays occur when opponent pass rates spike.

\paragraph{Balanced Team} Moderate pace with edges depending on opponent tendencies. Teaser value appears around key integers when market overreacts to recency.

\section{Team Profiles (Anonymous)}\label{app:team-profiles-anon}
