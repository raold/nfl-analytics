% Font Configuration: LaTeX Default (Computer Modern)
% This is LaTeX's native font - no special packages needed
% Computer Modern was designed by Donald Knuth specifically for TeX

% Microtype: Essential for improving typography
% - Character protrusion (letters hang slightly into margins)
% - Font expansion (subtle stretching/shrinking for better line breaks)
\usepackage[protrusion=true,expansion=true]{microtype}

% That's it! LaTeX will use Computer Modern by default
% No font packages = Computer Modern for text and math
