# Weather Analysis Summary Statistics

## Temperature Analysis (2020-2025)

- **Total Games**: 1021 outdoor games
- **Temperature Range**: -20.6°C to 43.0°C
- **Mean Temperature**: 14.3°C
- **Correlation (temp, total points)**: 0.0548 (p=0.7357)
- **Correlation (temp extreme, total points)**: -0.0045

## Extreme Conditions

- **Freezing Games (<0°C)**: 71
- **Extreme Heat (>30°C)**: 28
- **All Extremes (|T-15°C| > 15°C)**: 99

## Quadratic Model

- **R² (quadratic)**: 0.0030
- **Optimal Temperature**: 97.6°C (unrealistic, suggests linear model sufficient)

## Key Findings

1. **Temperature has NO significant correlation with scoring** (r=0.0548, p=0.080)
2. **Extreme temperatures do NOT reduce scoring** (p=0.76)
3. **Freezing conditions have NO effect** (p=0.89)
4. **Extreme heat has NO effect** (p=0.74)
5. **Precipitation interactions** show small sample (10 snow games, 61 rain games)
6. **Betting edge marginal**: Unders in extreme temps = 0.32% ROI (barely profitable)

## Comparison to Wind Analysis

Both wind and temperature show **null effects** on scoring:
- Wind correlation: r=0.0038, p=0.90
- Temp correlation: r=0.0548, p=0.08

**Conclusion**: Weather features provide minimal predictive value despite comprehensive engineering.
