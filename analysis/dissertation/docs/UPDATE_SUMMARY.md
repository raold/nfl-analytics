### 2. `/analysis/dissertation/chapter_3_data_foundation/chapter_3_data_foundation.tex` ✅
**Updates:** Added two new subsections with weather analysis findings

#### New Section 3.1.1: Weather feature engineering
- Documented Meteostat data source and 92.7% coverage (1,306/1,408 games)
- Described 6 derived features:
  - `temp_extreme` = |temp_c - 15| (deviation from optimal)
  - `wind_penalty` = wind_kph / 10 (normalized 0-5 scale)
  - `has_precip` (binary flag for rain/snow)
  - `is_dome` (indoor stadium indicator)
  - `wind_precip_interaction` (joint effect)
  - `temp_wind_interaction` (combined stress)
- Reported model performance: XGBoost +0.4%, GLM -0.7%
- **Key finding:** Weather effects are small relative to spread and EPA features

#### New Section 3.1.2: Wind impact hypothesis test  
- Statistical analysis of 1,017 outdoor games (2020-present)
- **Hypothesis REJECTED:** Wind does NOT reduce NFL scoring
- Evidence:
  - Pearson r = 0.0038 (p=0.90), not significant
  - T-test: no difference high vs low wind (p=0.43)
  - Chi-square: wind doesn't affect over/under (p=0.71)
  - High-wind under betting: 53.9% win rate, 3.01% ROI (marginally profitable)
- Possible explanations: modern stadiums, play-calling adjustments, improved kicking
- **Methodological importance:** Negative result guards against overfitting spurious effects

### 3. `/analysis/dissertation/chapter_5_rl_design/chapter_5_rl_design.tex` ✅
**Updates:** Added new subsection on DQN and PPO implementation

#### New Section 5.3.1: DQN and PPO Implementation
- **DQN architecture:** 3-layer network (128-64-32), 4 discrete actions (skip, small, medium, large)
- **DQN training:** 400 epochs on MPS, final Q=0.1539, peak at epoch 149 (Q=0.2323)
- **PPO architecture:** Actor-critic (64-32), continuous action via Beta distribution
- **PPO training:** 400 epochs on CPU (MPS unsupported), final reward=0.1324, peak at epoch 314
- **Stability comparison:**
  - PPO: 3.8× lower variance (0.004 vs 0.016 std), 2.1× lower training variance
  - DQN: 16.2% higher final performance, more loss spikes (14 vs 7)
- **Action space:** DQN 100% bet rate, PPO 57.7% avg action (more conservative)
- **Device compatibility:** DQN uses MPS (5 min), PPO requires CPU (12 min)
- **Recommendation:** PPO for deployment due to superior stability despite 16.2% reward trade-off
- Auto-includes `/figures/out/rl_agent_comparison_table.tex` if present

## Key Findings to Highlight in Defense

### 1. Weather Analysis (Negative Result)
- **Myth busted:** Wind does NOT reduce NFL scoring (p=0.90)
- **Methodological value:** Shows importance of testing domain intuitions empirically
- **Model impact:** Minimal improvement (+0.4% XGBoost accuracy)
- **Conclusion:** Weather features retained but not prioritized

### 2. RL Agent Stability Trade-offs
- **DQN:** Higher peak performance but less stable (3.8× higher variance)
- **PPO:** More consistent, risk-sensitive (3.8× lower variance)
- **Convergence:** Both agents plateau at 200-250 epochs
- **Deployment choice:** PPO preferred for real-world risk management
- **Action space:** Continuous (PPO) provides finer-grained control than discrete (DQN)

### 3. Multi-Model Ensemble
- **Best performer:** XGBoost at 95.3% accuracy (with weather features)
- **Baseline:** GLM at 91.8% accuracy
- **State-Space:** 72.1% accuracy (needs EPA integration improvement)
- **Weather impact:** Minimal (+0.4% max), EPA and spread remain dominant

## Remaining Work (from TODO.tex)

### High Priority (P0):
1. Generate reliability panels for GLM (per-season PNGs)
2. Run Quarto notebook 05 for copula GOF table
3. Evaluate PPO on 2024-2025 test set
4. Create injury feature engineering (mart.team_health view)

### Medium Priority (P1):
5. Implement tail dependence block bootstrap
6. Price teasers with calibrated margins
7. Compute key-number χ² tests
8. Run reweighting ablation (with/without key masses)
9. Expand test coverage from 6% to 40%+

### Low Priority (P2):
10. Diebold-Mariano tests (recent vs decayed forecasts)
11. RL vs baseline table (needs full evaluation)
12. Utilization-adjusted Sharpe computation

## LaTeX Compilation Tips

### If main.tex fails:
1. Check for undefined references: `grep undefined main.log`
2. Run full build cycle: `pdflatex && bibtex && pdflatex && pdflatex`
3. Clean auxiliary files: `latexmk -C` then rebuild
4. Check for missing citations: `grep "Warning.*Citation" main.log`

### Common issues fixed:
- ✅ Added `\mn` footnote helper for compatibility
- ✅ Used `\IfFileExists{}` guards for optional tables
- ✅ Wrapped long tables with `\sloppy` and `\hbadness=10000`
- ✅ Set `\tabcolsep` and `\arraystretch` locally to control spacing

### VS Code LaTeX Workshop:
1. Run "Clean up auxiliary files" from command palette
2. Run "Build LaTeX project" (may need 2× for references)
3. Check "Problems" panel for Overfull/Underfull warnings
