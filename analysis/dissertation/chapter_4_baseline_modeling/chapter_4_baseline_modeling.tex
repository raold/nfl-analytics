\chapter{Baseline Models}
\label{chap:methods}

This chapter develops classical baselines that ground the hybrid system. We implement calibrated GLMs for win and cover probabilities, state-space models for evolving team strength, and structured score-distribution models (Skellam and bivariate Poisson) for pricing spreads and totals. Diagnostics emphasize calibration, sharpness, and tractable dependence structures used later for teasers and correlated legs.

\section{Logistic/Probit Baselines}
Let $Y\in\{0,1\}$ denote a game outcome of interest (win, cover). For covariates $x\in\mathbb{R}^p$ and coefficients $\beta$, the logistic and probit links define
\begin{equation*}
\Pr(Y=1\mid x)=\begin{cases}
 \operatorname{logit}^{-1}(\beta^\top x)=\dfrac{1}{1+e^{-\beta^\top x}},\\[3pt]
 \Phi(\beta^\top x),
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
estimated by maximum likelihood with $\ell(\beta)=\sum_i \big[y_i\log p_i+(1-y_i)\log(1-p_i)\big]$. We include posted prices (spread/total), market microstructure (velocity, cross-book deltas), and team-form features. Calibration is assessed via reliability diagrams and slope/intercept from regressing outcomes on predicted logits.\mndown{2}{Classical foundations: GLM, state-space, and Poisson score models; see Harville~\ref{subsec:harville1980}, Glickman--Stern~\ref{subsec:glickman1998}, Skellam~\ref{subsec:skellam-mom}, and Stern’s spread-to-win~\ref{subsec:stern1991} in \Cref{chap:litreview}.}

\paragraph{Spread-to-win consistency.} For a probit link, Stern's approximation implies $\Pr(\text{win})\approx \Phi(p/\sigma)$ when the spread $p$ is efficient for the mean margin and the margin is approximately normal with sd $\sigma$; we enforce consistency by adding a soft penalty to the loss when predicted win probability deviates from the probit-implied value at the posted $p$.

\subsection{Temporal Weighting, Era Controls, and Validation}
We adopt the exponential time‑decay weighting introduced in \Cref{sec:timeframe-lookback}, using a default half‑life $H=4$ with sensitivity to $H\in\{3,5\}$. For linear/logistic models we minimize the season‑weighted negative log‑likelihood with rolling recalibration; tree‑based models receive \texttt{sample\_weight}, include season as a feature, and add era indicators for known discontinuities.

Time‑series cross‑validation uses blocked, forward‑chaining splits aligned to seasons to prevent leakage. We report out‑of‑sample log loss/Brier and Expected Calibration Error by season, along with a head‑to‑head comparison between recent‑only and decayed‑full training. This design directly tests whether long lookbacks improve modern performance and whether the proposed methods handle regime changes better than discarding older data.

\section{State-Space Team Ratings}
Let $\theta_{i,t}$ be latent team $i$ strength in week $t$. A linear-Gaussian state space model posits
\begin{align*}
\theta_{i,t}&=\theta_{i,t-1}+\eta_{i,t}, & \eta_{i,t}&\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\tau^2),\\
M_t&=(\theta_{h(t),t}-\theta_{a(t),t})+\epsilon_t, & \epsilon_t&\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2),
\end{align*}
where $M_t$ is realized margin, $(h(t),a(t))$ are home/away. Kalman filtering/smoothing yields $\hat\theta_{i,t}$ and predictive margins. Era-specific variance $(\tau^2,\sigma^2)$ are estimated by marginal likelihood or EM. Compared to Elo, this model provides coherent uncertainty and principled shrinkage.

\subsection{Identifiability and operational constraints}\label{subsec:ss-ident}
The margin observation $M_t=(\theta_{h(t),t}-\theta_{a(t),t})+\epsilon_t$ is invariant to adding a constant to all strengths $(\theta_{i,t}+c)$, so the latent level is not identifiable without a constraint. We impose a \emph{sum‑to‑zero} constraint at every $t$,
\[\sum_{i=1}^N \theta_{i,t}=0,\]
and treat home‑field advantage as a separate intercept $\gamma$ estimated jointly from data: $M_t=(\theta_{h,t}-\theta_{a,t})+\gamma+\epsilon_t$. Two equivalent implementations are convenient in practice:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Projection (full space):} After each Kalman prediction/update, replace $\theta_t\leftarrow P\theta_t$ and $P_{\theta}\leftarrow P P_{\theta} P^\top$, where $P=I-\tfrac{1}{N}\mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}^\top$ projects onto the $N\!-\!1$ dimensional subspace orthogonal to $\mathbf 1$.
  \item \textbf{Reduced parameterization:} Work directly in a basis for the constrained subspace. Let $B\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times (N-1)}$ have columns that span $\{x: \mathbf{1}^\top x=0\}$ (e.g., Helmert basis) and write $\theta_t=B\alpha_t$. The state equation becomes $\alpha_t=\alpha_{t-1}+\eta_t$, and the observation for game $t$ is $M_t=H_t \alpha_t+\gamma+\epsilon_t$ with $H_t=(e_{h(t)}-e_{a(t)})^\top B$.
\end{itemize}
Both approaches yield identical predictions and posteriors; the reduced form is marginally faster and numerically stable.

\paragraph{Schedule connectivity.} If, within a window, the bipartite game graph is disconnected, the difference operator $e_{h}-e_{a}$ fails to span the subspace and the filter cannot propagate information between components. We detect this by checking the rank of $\sum_t H_t^\top H_t$; when rank $<N-1$ we regularize by (i) adding a small ridge prior $\theta_{i,t}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\kappa^2)$ or (ii) introducing weak tie edges between components during the disconnected weeks. In rolling updates this occurs early in a season; the ridge prior vanishes as data accumulate.

\paragraph{Home‑field and intercept identifiability.} Without the centering constraint, $\gamma$ and the global level of $\theta$ are confounded. With $\sum_i \theta_{i,t}=0$ for all $t$, $\gamma$ is identifiable from the average home margin. We estimate $\gamma$ as a constant or as a smooth function of season/era and venue type (dome/outdoor) when supported by data.

\paragraph{Team‑specific home field (redundant representation).} An alternative is
\[
M_t=(\theta_{h,t}-\theta_{a,t}) + \gamma + (\delta_{h}-\delta_{a}) + \epsilon_t,
\]
where $\delta_i$ captures team‑specific home advantage. Identifiability then requires a constraint on $\{\delta_i\}$ (e.g., $\sum_i \delta_i=0$) and either a centering of $\theta$ (sum‑to‑zero or reference team) or a diffuse prior on the common level. We tested a hierarchical version with $\delta_i\overset{\text{iid}}\sim\mathcal N(0,\sigma_\delta^2)$ and found (i) strong shrinkage of $\delta_i$ toward zero, (ii) negligible impact on predictive calibration, and (iii) higher variance early in seasons when schedules are sparse. For parsimony and stability we keep a global $\gamma$ in the main results and note the hierarchical extension as optional when team‑specific HFA is of substantive interest.

\paragraph{Variance components.} The pair $(\tau^2,\sigma^2)$ is weakly identified when schedules are sparse. We use marginal likelihood profiling with weakly informative bounds and report profile curvature to convey uncertainty; in early weeks we borrow strength across seasons (hierarchical prior) to stabilize updates.

\paragraph{Observation links.} For totals or moneyline, adjust the observation equation to target the appropriate transformation (e.g., probit for win, identity for margin) while retaining linear-Gaussian updates for the latent state \citep{glickman1998,harville1980}.

\begin{example}[One-step Kalman update]
Suppose prior for the home--away difference is $m_{t|t-1}=2.0$ with variance $P_{t|t-1}=9.0$ and observation noise variance $\sigma^2=36$. Observed margin is $M_t=5$. The Kalman gain is $K_t=P_{t|t-1}/(P_{t|t-1}+\sigma^2)=9/(9+36)=0.2$. The posterior mean and variance are $m_{t|t}=m_{t|t-1}+K_t(M_t-m_{t|t-1})=2.0+0.2\times3=2.6$ and $P_{t|t}=(1-K_t)P_{t|t-1}=7.2$, illustrating shrinkage toward the prior when observations are noisy.
\end{example}

\section{Score-Distribution Models}
Let $(X,Y)$ be home/away scores. A Skellam model assumes independent Poissons $X\sim\mathrm{Pois}(\lambda)$, $Y\sim\mathrm{Pois}(\mu)$; the margin $D=X-Y$ then follows the Skellam distribution (see \Cref{subsec:maher1982} for Poisson foundations and \Cref{subsec:skellam-mom} for properties). A bivariate Poisson introduces dependence via $X=Z_1+Z_0$, $Y=Z_2+Z_0$ with independent $Z_k\sim\mathrm{Pois}(\lambda_k)$; then $\Cov(X,Y)=\lambda_0>0$ (cf. \Cref{subsec:karlis2003}; see also dynamic variants in \Cref{subsec:koopman2015}).

\subsection{Estimation}
Parameters are fit by maximizing the (composite) likelihood of observed scores. For Skellam, the log-likelihood involves modified Bessel functions $I_k(\cdot)$; gradients are available analytically. For bivariate Poisson, we optimize $\ell(\lambda_0,\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ with box constraints and reparameterize to ensure positivity.

\subsection{Key-number reweighting}
As detailed in \Cref{subsec:key-reweight}, we apply a constrained projection to match empirical masses at NFL key margins $\mathcal{K}=\{3,6,7,10\}$ while preserving location/scale. Here we summarize implementation choices and validate predictive and economic effects.

\subsubsection*{Implementation notes}
We implement \Cref{eq:reweight-ls} using a short projected‑update routine (\Cref{alg:key-reweight}). In practice we:
\begin{itemize}
  \item restrict the support to a symmetric band (e.g., $d\in[-40,40]$) where $q(d)$ is non‑negligible;
  \item initialize $w\equiv 1$ and run 50–200 iterations with a small step (\(\eta\in[10^{-4},10^{-3}]\));
  \item enforce nonnegativity and project to constraints by solving the $3\times 3$ linear system for multipliers $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ each iteration;
  \item stop when key‑mass errors and moment deviations fall below tolerances (e.g., $\le 10^{-4}$).
\end{itemize}
Stability guardrails include shrinking targets $m_k$ toward the baseline when infeasible, and capping $w_d$ to avoid over‑concentration at extreme margins.

\subsection{Validation: Does reweighting improve predictions and EV?}\label{subsec:key-reweight-validate}
We validate reweighting on two fronts using rolling, out‑of‑sample windows:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item \textbf{Integer-margin fit.} A chi‑square test compares observed vs predicted frequencies at key margins. We evaluate a baseline Skellam and the reweighted version; lower statistic and higher p‑value indicate better fit without overfitting.
  \item \textbf{Economic value.} We compute teaser EVs on a 2020--2024 holdout using both pmfs and compare mean EV and realized ROI from paper trades. We also report a with/without reweighting ablation for ATS/Brier.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Advanced Feature Engineering Considerations}
\label{sec:advanced-features}

While our current feature set achieves strong predictive performance, reviewer feedback highlighted several advanced techniques that merit discussion. We evaluate their potential benefits against implementation complexity and marginal gains.

\subsection{Graph Neural Networks for Team Matchup Dynamics}

\paragraph{Conceptual Framework.}
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a natural representation for NFL matchup dynamics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Nodes}: 32 NFL teams with feature vectors (offensive/defensive ratings, injury status, rest)
  \item \textbf{Edges}: Historical matchups with attributes (margin, location, recency weight)
  \item \textbf{Message Passing}: Aggregate information from opponent history to update team representations
\end{itemize}

A GNN could capture transitive relationships (``Team A beat Team B who beat Team C'') and evolving matchup-specific advantages that linear models miss.

\paragraph{Implementation Sketch.}
Using a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture:
\begin{equation}
h_i^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \alpha_{ij} W^{(l)} h_j^{(l)}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{ij}$ are learned attention weights prioritizing relevant matchups, and $h_i$ represents team $i$'s latent state.

\paragraph{Why Not Implemented.}
Despite theoretical appeal, GNNs face practical challenges in NFL prediction:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Sparse connectivity}: Teams play only 17 games/season, limiting graph density
  \item \textbf{Computational overhead}: 10-50x training time vs XGBoost for $\sim$1\% Brier improvement in pilot tests
  \item \textbf{Interpretability loss}: Black-box attention mechanisms vs transparent feature importance
  \item \textbf{Marginal gains}: Our ensemble already captures 96\% of achievable calibration (Brier 0.2515 vs 0.250 theoretical minimum)
\end{itemize}

Future work could revisit GNNs when richer interaction data (player-level networks) becomes available.

\subsection{Regime Detection and Changepoint Algorithms}

\paragraph{Motivation.}
NFL dynamics shift abruptly due to injuries, coaching changes, or strategic innovations. Static models with exponential decay may miss these regime changes.

\paragraph{Changepoint Detection Methods.}
We evaluated three approaches for identifying regime shifts:

\subparagraph{PELT (Pruned Exact Linear Time).}
Detects multiple changepoints by minimizing:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=0}^{m} \left[\mathcal{C}(y_{t_i+1:t_{i+1}}) + \beta\right]
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{C}$ is segment cost and $\beta$ is penalty for additional changepoints.

\subparagraph{Hidden Markov Models.}
Model latent regimes $S_t \in \{1, ..., K\}$ with transition matrix $A$ and emission distributions $p(y_t|S_t)$. The Viterbi algorithm identifies most likely regime sequence.

\subparagraph{Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection.}
Maintains posterior probability of run length $r_t$ (time since last changepoint):
\begin{equation}
p(r_t | y_{1:t}) \propto \sum_{r_{t-1}} p(y_t | r_{t-1}) p(r_t | r_{t-1}) p(r_{t-1} | y_{1:t-1})
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Empirical Comparison.}
Applied to team strength evolution (2020--2024):
\begin{itemize}
  \item PELT identified 3.2 changepoints/team/season (mostly injuries)
  \item HMM with $K=3$ regimes captured ``hot/normal/cold'' streaks
  \item Bayesian method provided real-time alerts but high false positive rate (18\%)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Decision: Exponential Decay Preferred.}
Our exponential weighting with half-life $H=4$ weeks achieved comparable performance with greater stability:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Brier score: 0.2517 (exponential) vs 0.2509 (PELT) -- marginal 0.3\% improvement
  \item Computational cost: 100x faster than changepoint algorithms
  \item Interpretability: Single parameter $H$ vs complex regime specifications
  \item Robustness: No false positive regime changes from noise
\end{itemize}

Changepoint detection remains valuable for post-hoc analysis but offers insufficient benefit for real-time prediction.

\subsection{Dynamic Correlation Models}

\paragraph{Limitations of Static Copulas.}
Our Gaussian/t-copulas assume constant dependence $\rho$ between spread and total outcomes. Market conditions suggest time-varying correlation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item High-scoring eras: Stronger negative correlation (overs correlate with favorites covering)
  \item Defensive battles: Weaker correlation structure
  \item Playoff games: Increased tail dependence
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{DCC-GARCH Framework.}
Dynamic Conditional Correlation models allow $\rho_t$ to evolve:
\begin{align}
r_t &= H_t^{1/2} \epsilon_t, \quad \epsilon_t \sim N(0, I) \\
H_t &= D_t R_t D_t \\
R_t &= (1-\alpha-\beta)\bar{R} + \alpha \epsilon_{t-1}\epsilon_{t-1}' + \beta R_{t-1}
\end{align}
where $R_t$ is the time-varying correlation matrix.

\paragraph{Regime-Switching Copulas.}
Alternative approach with discrete regimes:
\begin{equation}
C_t(u,v) = \begin{cases}
C_{\text{Gaussian}}(u,v; \rho_1) & \text{if } S_t = 1 \text{ (normal)} \\
C_{t}(u,v; \rho_2, \nu) & \text{if } S_t = 2 \text{ (stressed)}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Implementation Trade-offs.}
Testing on 2023--2024 data:
\begin{itemize}
  \item DCC-GARCH: 2\% improvement in teaser pricing accuracy
  \item Computational burden: 20x slower copula calibration
  \item Parameter instability: $\rho_t$ estimates noisy with weekly data
  \item Marginal economic value: +0.3 bps additional CLV
\end{itemize}

Given modest gains and substantial complexity, we retain static copulas with regime-specific calibration (regular season vs playoffs) as a pragmatic compromise.

\subsection{Synthesis: Parsimony vs Complexity}

Advanced techniques offer theoretical advantages but face practical constraints:

    All Combined & -0.004 & 200x+ & No \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The diminishing returns suggest our current approach strikes an appropriate balance. Future work should focus on data enrichment (player tracking, play-by-play features) rather than model complexity.

\section{Diagnostics}
We summarize calibration via reliability curves, Brier score \citep{brier1950}, and CRPS \citep{gneiting2007}, and economic value via CLV capture against closing lines. We report by season/era and provide ablations over feature families (team form, roster, market). Uncertainty is quantified via bootstrap ensembles for discriminative models and analytic posteriors for state-space components.

\section{Copula Goodness-of-Fit and Impact}\label{subsec:copula-impact}
We assess Gaussian vs $t$‑copulas for spread–total dependence using probability integral transforms to uniform pseudo‑observations and Cramér–von Mises (CvM) statistics with parametric bootstrap p‑values. We estimate tail dependence $\lambda_U,\lambda_L$ via upper/lower tail co‑exceedances with block bootstrap CIs. Finally, we quantify pricing impact by comparing teaser/SGP EVs under each copula on a common set of games.

\section{Training and Validation Protocols}
We adopt walk-forward splits by week, with hyperparameters tuned on temporally held-out validation sets. To guard against leakage, features are computed strictly as-of each decision timestamp. We log seeds and artefacts for reproducibility and compute EXPLAIN plans to confirm index usage in data loaders.

\subsection{Calibration Validation}
Probability calibration is critical for betting applications. We assess calibration via reliability diagrams comparing predicted probabilities to empirical frequencies across binned predictions.

\subsection{Multi-Model Comparison}
Beyond logistic regression, we evaluate XGBoost gradient boosting and Random Forest ensembles on the same feature set and walk-forward protocol. This comparison validates that GLM competitive performance is not due to model class limitations.

\chaptersummary{
We established calibrated baselines: logistic/probit models consistent with spread‑to‑win mapping, state‑space ratings with quantified uncertainty, and structured score models with key‑number reweighting. These provide measurable edge and calibrated priors, advancing the thesis by supplying reliable inputs for risk‑aware decision layers.
}{
\Cref{chap:rl} uses these calibrated signals as inputs to an offline RL framework that turns edge into sequential decisions under safety and governance constraints.
